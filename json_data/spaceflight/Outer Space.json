Various methods are used to measure space dust.\n\nInterplanetary dust particles in the Solar System scatter sunlight and emit thermal radiation, which is the most prominent feature of the night sky's radiation, with wavelengths ranging 5–50 μm. The sizes of dust particles near Earth typically range 10–100 μm. The total mass of the interplanetary dust cloud is approximately 3.5×1016 kg, or the mass of an asteroid of radius 15 km. This dust cloud is visible as the zodiacal light in a moonless and naturally dark sky, best seen sunward during astronomical twilight.\n\nPioneer spacecraft observations",

Class II structures can expand the initial facilities and be assembled before or after a crew arrives. Class III structures support a larger population and enable local building material production.\n\nTo develop the technology for these phases, Cohen and Kennedy (1997) suggest exploring robust robotic systems for construction and autonomy. They also stress the need to adapt structural components for robotic assembly and determine appropriate levels of modularity, assembly, and component packaging, as well as the development of experimental construc",

Humans traveled to the Moon as part of the Apollo program and have been continuously present in space on the International Space Station for over 23 years. China joined human spaceflight in 2003. Since the Apollo 17 mission in 1972, no human has traveled beyond low Earth orbit. Currently, the United States, Russia, and China are the only countries with human spaceflight programs, although non-governmental spaceflight companies have been developing their own programs for space tourism and commercial research.

They are consumed as food, produce oxygen, and help control cabin humidity, providing a psychological benefit to space crews. While initially for scientific studies, NASA plans to use space farming to feed astronauts and provide psychological benefits for long-term space flight. Challenges include growing plants without gravity, nutrient supply, and microbiological interactions in soil-based substrates. In 2017, Chinese cabbage was grown aboard the ISS for crew consumption. This concept dates back to the 1869 short story \"The Brick Moon\". The Apollo Moon tree project also contributed to forestry and a country's bicentennial celebration.",

It is designed to study Jupiter's moon Europa through a series of flybys while in orbit around Jupiter. This mission is the largest spacecraft NASA has ever developed for a planetary mission and is part of the Planetary Science Division's Large Strategic Science Mission. It will be funded under the Planetary Missions Program Office's Solar System Exploration program as its second flight, and is also supported by the Ocean Worlds Exploration Program.\n\nEuropa Clipper will follow up on studies made by the Galileo spacecraft, which indicated the existence of a subsurface ocean underneath Europa's ice crust. Initially conceived as a spacecraft to be injected into orbit around Europa, it was instead decided that it would be safer to inject a spacecraft into an elliptical orbit around Jupiter and make 44 close flybys of the moon, due to the adverse effects of radiation from Jupiter's magnetosphere in Euro",

It is a sub-genre of science fiction and is regulated by international treaties to limit the installation of space weapon systems. The first practical instance of space warfare occurred in 2023 during the Israel-Hamas War, when Israel's Arrow 2 system intercepted a ballistic missile launched from Yemen. In 2024, Iran launched over 120 ballistic missiles at Israel, marking the first large-scale incident of space weapon use. The United States Space Command existed from 1985 to 2002, merging with the United States Strategic Command. The United States Space Force is now the primary American military space force. The Russian Space Force was replaced by the Russian Aerospace Defence Forces but was reestablished as a component of the Russian Aerospace Forces.

It serves a range of purposes, from exploration to commercial use, settlement, and militarization. Achieved through space sciences and astronautics, humans have had a sustained presence in orbit around Earth since 1958 and have continuously crewed the ISS since 2000. However, this increasing presence has also brought the threat of space debris and the need for regulation and mitigation to ensure sustainable access to outer space. Securing this access has been pursued through space law and industry, but sustainability remains a challenge, with efforts to advance long-term sustainability in space activities. The United States sees this as a crucial goal of its contemporary space policy and program, recognizing the need for sustainable outer space activities.",

Einstein predicted in 1936 that light rays could converge to a focal point approximately 542 AUs from the Sun. A probe positioned at this distance could use the Sun as a lens to magnify distant objects. The Sun's gravitational field bends light more prominently closer to the Sun, and a proposed probe, SETIsail or FOCAL, could utilize the lens for imaging. NASA physicist Slava Turyshev presented a mission concept for direct imaging and spectroscopy of an exoplanet with a solar gravitational lens, proposing the use of realistic-sized solar sails to achieve the needed high velocity and reach the required distance in 17 years. This proposal was selected for Phase III of NIAC 2020. It is expected that the lens could reconstruct the exoplanet image with 25 km-scale surface resolution in 6 months of integration time, potentially revealing surface features and signs of habitability.",

It had its origins in the nuclear arms race following World War II and peaked with the Moon Race to land on the Moon. Spaceflight achievement was seen as necessary for national security and became part of the symbolism and ideology of the time. \n\nPublic interest in space travel began in 1951 with the publication of a Soviet youth magazine, and the competition officially began in 1955 with the announcement of plans to launch artificial satellites. The Soviet Union gained attention with the successful launch of Sputnik 1 in 1957 and the first human, Yuri Gagarin, into space in 1961. This led US president John F. Kennedy to commit to landing a man on the Moon before the end of the decade, which was achieved in 1969 with the flight of Apollo 11.\n\nThe USSR continued to pursue crewed lunar programs, but did not succeed, eventually canceling their program to focus on space stations and exploration of other planets. A period of détente followed with the joint Apollo–Soyuz Test Project in 1975. The collapse of the Soviet Union allowed the US and Russia to end their competition and cooperate on space programs, including the Shuttle–Mir and International Space Station programs in 1993.",

This includes satellite use, which began in 1962 with Telstar 1 transmitting TV signals. By 2004, global investment in space sectors was $50.8 billion, with 31% of space launches being commercial by 2010. The space economy is projected to reach $1.8 trillion by 2035.\n\nThe commercial spaceflight sector primarily generates revenue by launching satellites into Earth's orbit, with the FAA licensing U.S. spaceports and overseeing rocket launches. Global capacity is expanding in Russia, France, and China, with investment in reusable launch vehicles driving innovation. In 2022, 74 FAA-licensed commercial space operations were conducted, with expectations of doubling in the near future.\n\nCommercial satellite manufacturing encompasses non-military, civilian, governmental, and non-profit satellite production, ground equipment manufacturing, satellite subscription services, satellite imagery, telecommunications, navigation systems, and space tourism. Space commerce regulation has faced challenges, but legislation like the U.S. Commercial Space Launch Competitiveness Act aims to clarify ownership and encourage commercial space exploration.",

The Government of India launched ISpA in 2021 to open the industry to private sectors and start-ups. Several private companies are founding members of this organisation. India's space exploration began with the launch of sounding rockets from TERLS, leading to the development of small and larger launch vehicles in the 90s. Liberalisation of the space sector and nondisclosure agreements in the late 2010s led to the emergence of various private spaceflight companies. By 2019, India had launched more than 300 satellites for foreign states, and by early 2021, there were more than 40 startups in various stages of developing their ",

The system consists of four commercial high definition video cameras mounted on the exterior of the European Space Agency's Columbus laboratory module. It was the first large unpressurized NASA experiment to be delivered by SpaceX. The cameras streamed live video of Earth to be viewed online and on NASA TV, and now play previously-recorded video in a continuous loop on public streaming sites.\n\nThe HDEV system was developed by engineers at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, and designed with the help of high school students through NASA's High Schools United with NASA to Create Hardware program. The cameras were housed in a specific temperature enclosure and exposed to the radiation of space to help NASA determine which cameras work best in outer space.\n\nAfter over 5 years of operation exceeding its expected lifespan of 1 to 3 years, the HDEV system was removed from the Columbus module in May 2020 and transferred into the Cygnus NG-13 resupply spacecraft for disposal via destructive re-entry at the end of its mission. Following the end of HDEV, two of the International Space Station External High Definition Cameras (EHDCs) have been used to provide video to the HDEV live feed.",

Initiated by the European Space Agency and the French space agency CNES in 1999, it officially began operating in November 2000 after the Canadian Space Agency joined. The charter’s satellite assets have been used for various natural disasters, as well as for non-traditional purposes such as the search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 and the West Africa Ebola outbreak. As of 2018, it had been activated 579 times in 125 countries and had 17 member agencies and 34 satellites. It received the prestigious William T. Pecora Award in 2017.",

However, women are still significantly less often chosen for space missions than men, making up only 12% of all astronauts who have been to space as of June 2020. Most of the 70 women who have been to space are United States citizens, with other countries sending one, two, or three women on space missions. Women face the same physical and psychological challenges of spaceflight as men, but some studies suggest they may be better suited for longer missions. Despite this, gender discrimination remains a significant obstacle for women in space exploration.",

        "content": "Extraterrestrial life, or alien life, refers to life that originates from planets other than Earth. Despite extensive speculation and scientific research, no conclusive evidence of extraterrestrial life has been found. The possibility of intelligent extraterrestrial life is a subject of interest in the Drake equation and the field of astrobiology.\n\nThe idea of inhabited worlds beyond Earth has been discussed since antiquity, with early Christian writers and thinkers such as Democritus and Augustine considering the possibility. Pre-modern writers often assumed that extraterrestrial worlds are inhabited by living beings. In the 15th century, William Vorilong suggested that Jesus may have visited extraterrestrial worlds to redeem their inhabitants.\n\nThe search for signs of extraterrestrial life has intensified since the mid-20th century, using methods ranging from telescope and specimen analysis to radio communication. Scientific research on extreme and chemically harsh ecosystems on Earth, such as hydrothermal vents and acidic hot springs, has provided hope for the possibility of extraterrestrial life, despite the disparity in atmospheric composition and conditions on other planets.\n\nThe concept of extraterrestrial life and intelligence has had a significant cultural impact, particularly in fiction, where it has communicated scientific ideas and influenced public interest. There is debate over whether to attempt communication with extraterrestrial intelligence, with some advocating aggressive methods and others warning of potential dangers.",

Although von Kármán initially calculated a theoretical limit for airplane flight at 83.8 km (52.1 mi) above Earth, the later established Kármán line has no distinct physical significance and is subject to disagreement among experts. It is mainly used for legal and regulatory purposes, differentiating between aircraft and spacecraft. While international law does not define the edge of space or the limit of national airspace, most international organizations and regulatory agencies accept the FAI's Kármán line definition. Various countries and entities define space's boundary differently for their own purposes.",

It is sometimes applied to God in the Abrahamic tradition. The etymology of the title comes from the ancient Sumerian city of Kish, originally meaning \"King of Kish.\" The first ruler to use the title was Sargon of Akkad, and it was used by later empires claiming descent from his Akkadian Empire. The last known ruler to use the title was Antiochus I of the Seleucids. It is possible that the title was earned through successful military campaigns, and it may have had a similar counterpart, \"King of the Four Corners of the World.\" The literal translation of \"King of the Universe\" exists in many languages. In Hindi, it would be Nikhil Shah, and in Urdu, it would be Shah Jahan.",

However, some alleged sightings, such as a hoax perpetuated by science fiction writer Otto Binder, have been proven false. UFO proponents consider comments and photos from NASA as strong evidence, but a 1970 letter from NASA's Robert F. Allnut stated that there was no evidence of extraterrestrial spacecraft after years of space voyages. In 2009, NASA footage posted on YouTube renewed UFO conspiracy theories, and incidents were collected for a 2014 television series episode.",

They monitor short-term weather, climate change, and natural disasters, benefiting research subjects like meteorology, oceanography, ecology, and more. Sensors include passive and active remote sensors that measure energy across the electromagnetic spectrum. The use of satellite remote telemetry for climate research began in the 1960s, and political interest in gathering Earth remote-sensing data increased in the 1970s with new scientific evidence of rapid climate changes.",

In addition, Canada, Australia, Germany, Brazil, Algeria, Kazakhstan, Turkey, Argentina, Italy, Malaysia, Poland, South Africa, the Philippines, Egypt, Spain, Mexico, Thailand, and Chile have built or launched satellites.\n\nRussia and Ukraine inherited their space launch capabilities from the Soviet Union. Russia launches its rockets from its own and foreign (Kazakh) spaceports, while Ukraine launched from foreign (Kazakh and Russian) facilities until 2015 when political differences with Russia halted Ukraine's ability to produce orbital rockets.\n\nFrance and the United Kingdom became independent space powers following successful satellite launches. As of November 2021, ten countries and the European Space Agency (ESA) ",

Twelve men walked on the Moon and 842 pounds of lunar rocks and soil samples were returned to Earth, contributing to the understanding of the Moon's composition and geological history.\n\nTwo missions failed: a 1967 cabin fire killed the entire Apollo 1 crew, and the Apollo 13 mission was aborted by an oxygen tank explosion en route to the Moon. The crew circled the Moon and were returned safely to Earth using the LM Aquarius as a \"lifeboat\" for essential functions.",

The Soviet Union's Luna 2 was the first spacecraft to successfully impact the Moon in 1959, followed by Luna 9 achieving the first controlled soft landing and Luna 10 entering orbit. In 1968, the Zond 5 mission carried lifeforms (tortoises) close to the Moon.\n\nFrom 1968 to 1972, the United States conducted crewed missions as part of the Apollo program, with Apollo 8 being the first to enter orbit, and Apollo 11 landing the first humans on the Moon, including Neil Armstrong, the first person to walk on it. The Apollo 13 mission had to forgo its landing due to a spacecraft malfunction, but all ten crewed missions returned safely to Earth.\n\nThe Soviet Union also conducted uncrewed missions deploying rovers and returning samples, with three rover missions and eleven sample return flights attempted.\n\nIn 2018, China's Chang'e 4 mission soft-landed on the far side of the Moon, exploring the South Pole–Aitken basin and deploying the Yutu rover. In 2024, China successfully landed the Chang'e 6 mission in the Apollo crater on the far side, collecting lunar samples.\n\nMissions to the Moon have been conducted by various nations and organizations, includi",

From 1981 to 2011, 135 missions were flown from Kennedy Space Center, totaling over 1,300 days of flight time. The program flew 355 people from 16 countries and included 852 total shuttle fliers. The shuttles docked with the Russian space station Mir nine times and visited the ISS thirty-seven times. The first orbiter built, Enterprise, was used for flight tests. Four operational orbiters were built: Columbia, Challenger, Discovery, and Atlantis. Challenger and Columbia were destroyed in accidents in 1986 and 2003, killing fourteen astronauts. A fifth orbiter, Endeavour, was built to replace Challenger. The Space Shuttle was retired from service after STS-135 in July 2011.",

NASA approved the project in January 2020, and the segment is planned to become its own space station, Axiom Station. It is uncertain which launch vehicles will be used for these modules. Up to three modules are set to be attached to the ISS, with the first expected to launch no earlier than late 2026 and dock to the forward port of Harmony. Axiom Space plans to add two more modules and send private astronauts to inhabit the space. R",

It does not include uncrewed spacecraft or crewed flights below 80 km. There is debate over the height of space, but this article uses 80 km as the threshold.\n\nSince Vostok 1 in 1961, there have been 13 types of crewed spacecraft – nine American, three Russian, and one Chinese. There are currently five operational crewed spacecraft, eight retired types, and spacecraft in development. There are two space stations in orbit – the International Space Station and the Chinese Tiangong.\n\nCrewed spacecraft must support human life and have a human-rating certification. They must have a breathable atmosphere, pressurization, and temperature regulation. Crewed spacecraft include space capsules, spaceplanes, and space stations.",

They are segregated to show progression in complexity and capacity, including the establishment of the agency, development of launch capability, capacity for extraterrestrial exploration, and demonstration of human spaceflight capability.\n\nThe fifth listing identifies countries considering or developing space agency organizations but have not ratified formation or operation. The demonstrated capabilities represent national or regional capacity to achieve the identified objectives, and do not determine unique funding sources.\n\nIt is noted that many space programs involve cooperation between civil agencies and military organizations to support space programs given the geographical expanse required for successful operation.",

The comparison lists the attributes of current and future individual rocket configurations designed to reach orbit. The first list includes operational rockets as of 2024 and those that have attempted an orbital flight, while the second list includes upcoming rockets. For a simple list of all conventional launcher families, see Comparison of orbital launchers families. For predominantly solid-fueled systems, see Comparison of solid-fueled orbital launch systems.\n\nSpacecraft propulsion accelerates spacecraft and satellites. Orbital launch systems are rockets and systems capable of reaching Earth orbit. Current systems use chemical rockets, falling into three main categories:\n\n1. Solid-propellant rockets use solid propellants ignited from the inside and burning radially outward.\n2. Liquid-propellant rockets feed liquid propellants into a combustion chamber, usually usi",

Despite being old, early shuttle astronauts liked its history and tradition, and even opposed getting a new one. During the twenty-minute drive to the launch pad, the van would stop at least once for an astronaut to assess the weather conditions. Senior NASA managers occasionally rode along and were dropped off at the Launch Control Center.",

Over five days, the Block D stage was ignited three times to raise the initial orbit to a final one. The spacecraft also carried other experiments, including a prototype environmental control ",

The Lagrange points L4 and L5 are stable if the mass of the larger body is at least 25 times the mass of the secondary body, making them potential sites for space colonies. Gerard K. O'Neill suggested in 1974 that the Earth-Moon L5 point could accommodate thousands of floating colonies and would allow for easy travel to and from the colonies due to the shallow effective potential ",

Located 40 kilometers south of Malargüe, it has two sister stations in Spain and Australia, completing the ESTRACK network for continuous tracking of deep space missions. The station's 35-meter dish antenna was hoisted into place in 2011 and underwent tests in 2012 before becoming fully operational in 2013. It provided communications, tracking, and data download from the Rosetta spacecraft. The station features a 20kW CW High Power Amplifier created by Rhein",

The approach has been acknowledged by some scientists, but has practical drawbacks. The proposed method involves redirecting asteroids or comets around Earth's orbit and towards Jupiter or Saturn to gradually move Earth away from the Sun, keeping it habitable. However, this long-term plan poses risks, such as potential loss of the Moon and disruptions to Earth's climate and rotation. Lengthening Earth's orbital period could also disrupt global seasonal weather patterns. The close encounters with asteroids or comets could also end most life on the planet if not carefully calculated.",

NASA developed the Man-System Integration Standards (MSIS) in the 1980s, based on measurements of crew members in microgravity, to define an average NBP. Still photographs from Skylab showed a distinct posture with raised arms, abducted shoulders, flexed knees, and plantar flexed feet. Research on Space Shuttle mission STS-57 found greater individual variations in NBP than the Skylab study suggested, with three main postures exhibited by the crew as a whole. These differences could be due to athletic bearing, type and amount of exercise, past physical injuries, and gender differences. No single crew member exhibited the typical NBP per MSIS standards.\n\nThe neutral body posture occurs in weightlessness, relieving musculoskeletal stress and reducing pressure on the diaphragm and spine. It supports the natural curvature of the spine, curving inward at the neck, outward at the upper back, and inward at the lower back. NASA standards for NBP have influenced seat design for commercial vehicles, with Nissan Motor Company using N",

Its goal was to create an autonomous rover to survey the distribution of microbes on Antarctica's ice sheets. The robot was designed to have full navigational autonomy and operate unattended for one month without human intervention. It used a combination of solar power and wind power for sustainable energy, including solar panels and a deployable wind turbine. A working model called Nomad was tested in 2005 on a frozen lake in New Hampshire, successfully completing a ten kilometer test run and conducting a test of its wind turbine. The test also led to further calibratio",

Unlike a pure gravity assist, which relies solely on a planet's gravity to change trajectory, an AGA involves dipping into the planet's atmosphere to use aerodynamic lift and gravity to further curve the spacecraft's path, resulting in a higher change in velocity. This allows for shorter travel times, a larger payload fraction, or a smaller spacecraft for a given payload. The goal of AGA is to achieve a larger change in direction by using the planet's atmosphere, as opposed to using it to slow the spacecraft down. Whil",

Satellites in ASO have an orbital period equal to Mars' sidereal day and an altitude of 17,000 kilometers. An areostationary orbit (AEO) is a type of ASO that appears fixed in the sky to an observer on the surface of Mars. While no satellites currently occupy ASO or AEO, some scientists foresee a future telecommunications network for the exploration of Mars.",
