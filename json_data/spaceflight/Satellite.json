After leaving Earth orbit, telemetry indicated a leak in the orientation system, so the spacecraft was transferred to gyroscopic stabilization. It sent sixty-one radio transmissions containing a large amount of interplanetary data before communications ceased on March 21, 1963, likely due to a failure in the antenna orientation system.

In addition to providing internet service, IRIS² will be used for space surveillance and detecting spy balloons. The project is part of the EU's overall space strategy and is expected to be executed by a consortium including Airbus Defence and Space, Thales Alenia Space, and Arianespace. The constellation is planned to be launched by European rockets, but there may be consideration of foreign contractors if there are further delays. As of April 2024, the awarding of the contract for the project was put on hold by the European Commission.",

In December 2022, it reached over 1 million subscribers, increasing to 3 million by May 2024. The total cost of the constellation is estimated to be at least US$10 billion, with reported revenues of $1.4 billion in 2022 and an expected reach of $6.6 billion in 2024.\nStarlink has been utilized in the Russo-Ukrainian War and has a military version called Starshield for government use. Astronomers have expressed concerns about the impact of the constellation on ground-based astronomy and the crowded orbital environment. SpaceX has implemented measures to reduce interference and equipped the satellites with thrusters to maneuver and avoid collisions.",

Devices that support both GPS and GLONASS have access to more satellites, allowing for quicker and more accurate positioning, especially in urban areas and high latitudes. Development of GLONASS began in the Soviet Union in 1976, with the constellation completed in 1995. The system experienced a decline in the late 1990s, but funding and government support were increased in 2001. By 2010, GLONASS achieved full coverage of Russia's territory, and in 2011, the full global orbital constellation was restored. The system's satellites have been upgraded over the years, with the latest version, GLONASS-K2, launched in 2023. In 2020, Glonass-BDD LLC used the system to analyze and prevent traf",

They primarily support the People's Liberation Army's Strategic Support Force and utilize various means of remote sensing, including optical reconnaissance, synthetic-aperture radar (SAR), and electronic intelligence (ELINT) for maritime surveillance. The satellites are launched from several different satellite launch centers in China. While individual satellites are referred to by their numbers, they are categorized by their military Jianbing designation, with the first Yaogan satellite being part of the Jianbing-5 (JB-5) series. The Jianbing designations remain unknown to the public, as they are kept secret by the Chinese military.",

It is designed to conduct lunar exploration in conjunction with the Lanyue lander by the end of the decade. A low-earth orbit version is also being developed to ferry astronauts to the Tiangong Space Station as a replacement for the existing Shenzhou spacecraft. China unveiled the official names of its new vehicles for future crewed lunar exploration missions on Feb. 24, 2024, with the crewed spacecraft named Mengzhou, meaning “Dream Vessel”, and the crewed lunar lander named \"Lanyue\", meaning “Embracing the Moon”.",

Its goals were to investigate the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) of the universe and provide measurements that would help shape our understanding of the cosmos. COBE's measurements provided key support for the Big Bang theory, showing that the CMB has a near-perfect black-body spectrum and very faint anisotropies.

GRACE provided important data for studying Earth's ocean, geology, and climate, and was a collaborative effort involving multiple institutions. The principal investigator was Byron Tapley of the University of Texas, and the co-principal investigator was Christoph Reigber of the GeoForschungsZentrum (GFZ) Potsdam. The two satellites, GRACE-1 and GRACE-2, were launched in 2002 and operated for 15 years, far exceeding their 5-year design lifespan. In 2019, a glacier in West Antarctica was named after the GRACE mission.",

Named after astronomer Edwin Hubble and one of NASA's Great Observatories, Hubble has a 2.4 m mirror and five main instruments observing in the ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared regions. Its position outside Earth's atmosphere allows for high-resolution, low-background light images. Hubble has led to breakthroughs in astrophysics, including determining the rate of expansion of the universe.\n\nThe telescope was proposed in 1923 and funded and built by NASA in the 1970s. Delays, budget issues, and the 1986 Challenger disaster pushed back its launch to 1990, with a flaw in the main mirror corrected by a servicing mission in 1993. Hubble is unique in that it is designed to be maintained in space by astronauts, with a total of five Space Shuttle missions repairing, upgrading, and replacing systems, including all five main instruments. Despite initial safety concerns following the 2003 Columbia disaster, the fifth mission was ultimately completed in 2009. Hubble has completed 30 years of operation and is expected to last until 2030–2040.\n\nHubble is part of NASA's Great Observatories program and is focused on visible light observations, complemented by other telescopes covering different parts of the spectrum.

        "content": "The Orbiting Frog Otolith (OFO) program, launched by NASA in 1970, sent two bullfrogs into orbit to study the effects of weightlessness on the otolith, an inner ear balance mechanism. The experiment, part of NASA's Office of Advanced Research and Technology, aimed to gather information for human spaceflight by studying the adaptability of the otolith to sustained weightlessness and its role in equilibrium control. Originally developed by Torquato Gualtierotti of the University of Milan, the project was delayed and eventually launched on November 9, 1970, after being approved in 1967. Interest in the research continued after the successful mission, leading to the initiation of the Vestibular Function Research project in 1975. The program has also led to the development of the ground-based Vestibular Research Facility at ARC. The OFO program should not be confused with other orbiting observatory spacecraft programs.",

It is one of the oldest, cheapest, and most successful air-to-air missiles and remains standard equipment for most Western-aligned air forces. Its adaptability and infrared guidance system have made it an effective weapon, with the most widely used air-to-air missile in the West. More than 110,000 missiles have been produced for the US and 27 other nations, with an estimated 270 aircraft kills. Boeing won a contract in 2010 to support Sidewinder operations through the year 2055, and it is likely to remain in Air Force inventories through the late 21st century due to its low cost, versatility, and reliability.",

Starlink has been used by civilians, government, and military for humanitarian and defense purposes. Initially funded by SpaceX, the US Department of Defense now covers expenses through a contract. Starlink availability is not extended to Russian-occupied territories, causing criticism from Ukraine. Elon Musk denied extending coverage to Crimea due to US sanctions on Russia. The use of Starlink to attack Russian targets has been criticized by Russian officials, who have tried to disrupt services. Despite controversies, SpaceX announced a government program called Starshield for military use. Musk's involvement in the war has been significant and met with concerns.",

For example, 1990-037A is the Space Shuttle Discovery on mission STS-31, which carried the Hubble Space Telescope (1990-037B) into space. This designation system is named after the Committee on Space Research (COSPAR) of the International Council for Science, which replaced the earlier designation system based on the Greek alphabet. The modern system was introduced in 1963, but some older satellites have been retroactively given designators in this format.",

        "content": "Space-based solar power (SBSP, SSP) involves collecting solar energy in outer space and transmitting it to Earth. It has advantages such as higher energy collection, little to no night, and better orientation to the Sun. SBSP systems convert sunlight into energy that can be transmitted to receivers on Earth's surface through microwaves.\n\nResearch on SBSP has been ongoing since the 1970s, but as of 2014, the high space launch costs have prevented its economic viability. Some propose lowering costs through space manufacturing or new space launch technologies.\n\nApart from cost, SBSP also faces technological hurdles, including transmitting energy from orbit and the associated inefficiencies. Concerns include land use for antenna stations and the service life of space-based collectors in the harsh space environment.\n\nAs of 2020, SBSP is actively pursued by Japan, China, Russia, India, the United Kingdom, and the US. Japan has passed laws to establish space solar power as a national goal, with plans to commercialize SBSP. China has also showcased its roadmap for building a working space solar power station, with plans to launch several space power stations between 2021 and 2025.\n\nIn May 2020, the US Naval Research Laboratory conducted its first test of solar power generation in a satellite. In August 2021, Caltech announced plans to launch a SBSP test array by 2023, with funding from donors. A Caltech team successfully demonstrated beaming power to Earth in 2023.",

The location is typically determined using GPS and transmitted using SMS, GPRS, or satellite or terrestrial radio. GSM and EVDO are the most common services used, and satellite technology is also used for global coverage and remote locations. Other methods for determining location include dead reckoning, active RFID systems, and terrestrial radio positioning systems. These systems may be used in combination in some cases.",

They use cheap voltage controlled oscillator to compensate clock differences among pseudolites. Pseudolites are also used to improve GPS precision and implement indoor location systems. Research is being conducted to deploy pseudolite arrays for planetary exploration, allowing rovers to calibrate the system to centimeter-level resolution without human assistance. Other applications include precision approach landing systems for aircraft and accurate tracking of transponders. Pseudolites are gaining attention for indoor location systems.",

Created by the Radio Technical Commission for Maritime Services, it has been used with marine radio, satellite broadcasts, and internet distribution. The format was first released in 1990 and updated in 2003 to improve efficiency and increase the number of messages for real-time GPS corrections. The latest version is 3.3, or 10403.3, with Amendments 1 and 2. While RTCM SC-104 is not the only standard for DGPS, most other similar standards have fallen into disuse with the introduction of version 3.1.",
