The first reports were made in February 1946 by Finnish observers, with around 2,000 sightings logged between May and December of that year. Radar returns verified 200 sightings, and physical fragments attributed to ghost rockets were recovered. Investigations suggested that many sightings were likely caused by meteors, although some did not align with meteor shower activity and displayed characteristics inconsistent with meteors, such as reported maneuverability.\n\nThe origins of the unidentified ghost rockets continue to be debated. In 1946, it was thought that they may have originated from the former German rocket facility at Peenemünde and were long-ra",

Variants were designed to test radio-controlled guidance, inertial guidance, and warhead separation and ablative heat shielding. The Diamant rocket, developed from the Saphir, carried the first French satellite into orbit. After the successful launch of Diamant, Saphir rockets were used to test technologies for France's intercontinental ballistic missile development.",

        "content": "Space Shuttle Challenger (OV-099) was a second Space Shuttle orbiter to fly into space after Columbia. It was destroyed in a disaster in January 1986, killing all seven crew members aboard. Initially manufactured as a test article, it was pressed into operational service in the Space Shuttle program. During its three years of operation, Challenger was flown on ten missions, spending over 62 days in space and completing almost 1,000 orbits around Earth.\n\nChallenger was used for numerous civilian satellite launches and was also used as a test bed for various space technologies. On its tenth flight in January 1986, Challenger broke up 73 seconds after liftoff, killing the seven-member crew of STS-51-L. The cause of the disaster was attributed to a failed O-ring seal in one of Challenger's solid rocket boosters. The loss of Challenger and its crew led to significant changes in the Space Shuttle program to improve crew safety. The recovered remains of the orbiter are mostly buried in a missile silo located at Cape Canaveral LC-31, though one piece is on display at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex.",

It retained unique features indicative of its experimental design, including test instrumentation and distinctive black chines. Throughout its 22 years of operation, Columbia completed 28 missions, spending over 300 days in space and completing over 4,000 orbits around Earth. It was used for scientific research and historic missions, such as carrying the first female commander of an American spaceflight mission and the first Israeli astronaut.\n\nHowever, at the end of its final flight in February 2003, Columbia disintegrated upon reentry, killing the seven-member crew and destroying most of the scientific payloads aboard. An investigation concluded that damage sustained during launch fatally compromised the vehicle's thermal protection system. The loss of Columbia led to changes in NASA's human exploration programs and the establishment of the Constellation program in 2005, ultimately leading to the retirement of the Space Shuttle program in 2011. Numerous memorials and dedications have been made to honor the crew, including the Columbia Memorial Space Center and the naming of the Columbia Hills on Mars' Gusev crater after the crew.",

It is often used in science classes to demonstrate principles of chemistry and physics.\n\nIn the experiment, water and an effervescent tablet are added to the canister, which is then sealed tightly. The pressure of the carbon dioxide causes the canister to be launched into the air with a popping sound. Various experiments and lessons can be conducted with the bicarbonate rocket, such as adjusting the amounts of water and Alka-Seltzer to propel the rocket the greatest distance or deriving equations to calculate its speed and velocity.\n\nThe experiment demonstrates Newton's third law of motion, with the chemical reaction rapidly creating gas that is expelled in one direction from the rocket engine, forcing the rocket in the opposite direction. The film canister rocket uses solid and liquid fuel to create carbon dioxide gas, which escapes out ",

The air-launched rocket was designed to carry smallsat payloads into Sun-synchronous orbit after being air-launched from a modified Boeing 747-400. Despite early setbacks, including a failed test flight in 2020, the rocket successfully delivered payloads to low Earth orbit in three flights. However, the final flight in 2023 also failed to reach orbit. With LauncherOne being the first all liquid-fuelled air-launched orbital rocket, Virgin Orbit had originally intended for it to carry a smaller 200 kg payload before increasing its capacity to 300 kg to better target their intended market. With Virgin Orbit ceasing operations after bankruptcy in 2023, the future of LauncherOne is uncertain.",

Antares made its first flight in April 2013 and has been used to launch the Cygnus spacecraft for NASA's COTS and CRS programs. The rocket suffered a catastrophic failure in 2014 but returned to flight successfully in 2016. The Antares has flown two major design iterations, the 100 series and 200 series, and is currently under development for the 300 series. Due to political tensions between Ukraine and Russia, Northrop Grumman has entered into agreements with other aerospace companies for the production of the rocket's first stage.",

It was a liquid propellant rocket burning RP-1 kerosene fuel with liquid oxygen in three engines configured in an unusual \"stage-and-a-half\" design. The name Atlas was proposed by Karel Bossart and his design team at Convair to reflect the missile's position as the biggest and most powerful at the time, as well as the parent company of Convair, the Atlas Corporation.\n\nThe missiles saw brief ICBM service, but from 1962-1963, Atlas boosters launched the first four US astronauts to orbit the Earth.

Development began in 1946 and faced multiple cancellations and re-starts before becoming a crash project in late 1952 due to the escalating Cold War and intelligence showing Soviet ICBM development. The first test launch in June 1957 failed, but the successful launch of the Soviet R-7 Semyorka in August created new urgency. Despite reliability issues with the first models, the Atlas C was declared operational in September 1959. Atlas was seen as a last-ditch weapon to counter a Soviet sneak attack on US bomber bases, but new designs, like the Minuteman, made it obsolete for ICBM use by 1965. However, it continued to have a successful history as a space launch vehicle, launching Project Mercury astronauts and becoming the foundation for a family of space launch vehicles. The Atlas Centaur line was acquired by the United Launch Alliance, which continues to support the larger Atlas V. Retired Atlas ICBMs were also refurbished and used to launch satellites until 1995.",

The D-series Atlas was launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station and Vandenberg Air Force Base. It incorporated design changes from previous models and featured the full-up Rocketdyne MA-2 propulsion system with 360,000 pounds-force of thrust. Most space launcher variants of the Atlas were based on the Atlas D.",

It differed from the Atlas E in its vertical silo with an elevator, and utilized the MA-3 propulsion system with a total thrust of 375,000 pounds-force. The ARMA inertial guidance system was also used, with minor differences between the E and F versions. Refurbished Atlas F space launches often used solid-fueled upper stages, with the last launch in 1981 placing a NOAA weather satellite into orbit. These space launchers were extensively rebuilt by Convair, with the ARMA system replaced with the GE Mod II guidance system.",

The first static test-firing was in March 2001, and the first launch was in November 2002. The Delta IV Heavy, featuring three CBCs, had a malfunction on its first flight but improvements were made. In total, the Delta IV made 45 flights before retiring in 2024, with a total of 77 CBCs launched. The CBCs were manufactured in Alabama and transported to launch sites for integration with the spacecraft and other components.",

The various models of Atlas were launched numerous times between 1991 and 2005, with the Atlas V still in service and launches ",

The NPO Lavochkin-manufactured Fregat is the most commonly used upper stage. Soyuz-2 rockets were first launched from Baikonur Cosmodrome and Plesetsk Cosmodrome, and have also been launched from the Centre Spatial Guyanais (CSG). In 2016, the Vostochny Cosmodrome began operating Soyuz-2 flights from its first launch pad. Soyuz-2 has replaced the Molniya-M, Soyuz-U, and Soyuz-FG rockets since 2010, 2017, and 2019, respectively. Production of Soyuz-U rockets was halted in April 2015, and the final flight took place in 2017, carrying Progress MS-05 to the International Space Station (ISS).",

However, in 1996, it was retired due to the additional cost of production not justifying the performance advantage. The final flight, Soyuz TM-22, occurred on 3 September 1995.

It would use Shuttle external tank and Solid Rocket Boosters with a cargo module instead of the orbiter. The concept aimed to reduce costs by reusing shuttle technology and hardware. After the Challenger incident, the Shuttle-C was considered for its potential to support a higher flight rate due to lower maintenance and safety requirements. It was planned to be the main crew launch vehicle for the International Lunar Resources Exploration Program and was even considered for a crewed mission to Mars in the early 1990s. The concept has been studied since the 1970s and was discussed in Gerard O'Neill's \"The High Frontier: Human Colonies in Space.\"",

However, in 2023, the Baiterek joint venture filed a claim against Roscosmos for failing to conduct an environmental impact assessment, effectively ending the Baiterek project and the development of the Irtysh launch vehicle scheduled to start from Site 45 in 2024.",

The station has three active launch pads and a 10,000-foot runway for military airlift aircraft.\n\nCCSFS has a rich history in American space exploration, launching numerous pioneering missions including the first U.S. Earth satellite, first U.S. astronaut, first U.S. astronaut in orbit, and the first spacecraft to leave the Solar System. Portions of the base have been designated a National Historic Landmark.\n\nThe facility has undergone several name changes over the years, including Cape Canaveral Launch Area, LRPG Launching Area, Cape Canaveral Auxiliary Air Force Base, and Cape Canaveral Missile Test Annex. It was later known as Cape Kennedy Air Force Station and Cape Canaveral Air Force Station before being renamed \"Cape Canaveral Space Force Station\" in December 2020.",

They can be reloaded with new grenades and are stabilized in flight with fins. The high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) warheads are effective against lightly armored vehicles, but modern heavily-armored vehicles are generally too well-protected to be penetrated, though they can still cause secondary damage to vulnerable systems. The term \"rocket-propelled grenade\" comes from the Russian acronym for \"handheld anti-tank grenade launcher.\"",

It was the first crewed spacecraft to operate in the vacuum of space and remains the only crewed vehicle to land anywhere beyond Earth. Due to its inability to fly through Earth's atmosphere, the LM was ferried to lunar orbit attached to the Apollo command and service module (CSM). Ten lunar modules were launched into space, with six of them landing on the Moon from 1969 to 1972. The first two were tests in low Earth orbit, while the third was a test in low lunar orbit. The Apollo 13 lunar module served as a lifeboat to keep the crew alive after their CSM was disabled by an oxygen tank explosion en route to the Moon. The six landed descent stages remain at their landing sites, while their corresponding ascent stages crashed into the Moon. One ascent stage was discarded in a heliocentric orbit, and the remaining three LMs were burned up in the Earth's atmosphere.

Founded by John Carmack, the company won $350,000 in 2008 and $500,000 in 2009 for the Northrop Grumman Lunar Lander Challenge. In 2010, they partnered with Space Adventures for suborbital rocket tourist flights. But setbacks, including a 2013 crash, led to the company being put on hold. In 2014, former employees formed Exos Aerospace and acquired Armadillo's assets. In 2018, Exos launched the Suborbital Active Rocket with Guidance (SARGE) from New Mexico. Carmack hinted at a potential comeback for Armadillo Aerospace in 2017, suggesting his own future plans could include reviving the company.",

The project focused on showcasing a new nontoxic spacecraft propellant system using methane and oxygen, as well as autonomous landing and hazard detection technology. The lander's prototype was designed for autonomous flight, including vertical takeoff and landings, and has the capability to transport 1,100 pounds of cargo on the Moon.\n\nThe Alpha prototype lander, about 12 feet in diameter and weighing approximately 2,400 pounds, was built at NASA's Johnson Space Center and Armadillo Aerospace's facility near Dallas. The project utilized \"lean development\" engineering practices to save time and costs, with activities including ground and flight operations, range safety, and software development.\n\nBy 2015, the Morpheus project had saved an estimated $50 million through streamlined processes, minimized documentation, and purchasing parts from commercial suppliers. The project concluded with six formal documents and the return of the lander to JSC.",

Ground and flight tests took place at the ISAS Noshiro Rocket Testing Center. JAXA proposed to develop a reusable high-altitude rocket using RVT technologies, capable of carrying a 100 kg payload to an altitude of 100 km. The rocket, with equipment derived from RVT, is expected to cost 50 billion yen to develop and be capable of five flights per day at a cost of 10,000 yen per flight. Experimental payloads will be recovered after the flight, reducing costs for payload developers, and the vehicle will have the capability to stop and hover at any altitude",

They conducted three hover flights in 1999, but closed in early 2001 after exhausting funds. The concept originated from McKinney's idea of using helicopter blades for a launch vehicle and gained funding from billionaire Walt Anderson and Tom Clancy, allowing the company to launch in October 1996.",

The spacecraft and booster feature Raptor engines burning liquid methane and liquid oxygen, made from a stainless steel alloy. The spacecraft can re-enter the atmosphere and perform a 'belly flop' maneuver, while lunar and depot variants do not require a thermal protection system. The development involves test flights that often result in the destruction of the prototype vehicles. As a successor to Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets, Starship will support various space missions and rely on orbital refueling for farther destinations. The Starship HLS variant will also land astronauts on the Moon as part of the Artemis program. SpaceX plans to deploy its second-generation Starlink satellite constellation using Starship. A ship-to-ship propellant transfer demonstration is expected in 2025 to prove out this critical capability.",

It will launch from Earth on a Starship rocket and be refueled in orbit before heading to a lunar near-rectilinear halo orbit (NRHO). There, it will rendezvous with a crewed Orion spacecraft launched from Earth by NASA's Space Launch System. Two astronauts will transfer from Orion to HLS for a 7-day mission with at least five EVAs before returning to Orion in NRHO.\n\nIn April 2021, NASA awarded SpaceX a contract to develop, produce, and demonstrate Starship HLS. An uncrewed test flight is planned for 2025, followed by a crewe",

The programme included the development and launch of the Buran-class orbiters, with orbiter 1K completing one uncrewed spaceflight in 1988. The project was a response to the US Space Shuttle program and benefited from extensive espionage undertaken by the KGB, resulting in many similarities between American and Soviet Shuttle designs. The Buran-class orbiters used the expendable Energia rocket as a launch vehicle and had the capability of flying uncrewed missions and performing fully automated landings. The project was the largest and most expensive in the history of Soviet space exploration.",

The compact and wooden aircraft had a reclined seating position for the pilot and a unique jettisonable nose escape system. Despite being cancelled in 1939 due to its small size and performance, the He 176 proved the concept of rocket propulsion and high-speed flight. Lessons learned from the project were used in subsequent aircraft such as the Heinkel He 280 and the Messerschmitt Me 163. Most documentation and the prototype were destroyed during the war, but some material may have ended up in Soviet/Russian archives. Only two pictures of the He 176 have survived. The often-quoted performance data, such as its speed of 750 km/h or 800 km/h, is based on anecdotal evidence and not on sound documents.",

It is the only operational rocket-powered fighter aircraft in history and the first piloted aircraft to exceed 1,000 km/h in level flight.\n\nDevelopment of the Me 163 can be traced back to 1937 and the work of Alexander Lippisch and DFS. Plans for a propeller-powered aircraft were dropped in favor of rocket propulsion. The prototype performed its maiden flight on September 1, 1941, impressing German officials and leading to plans for widespread introduction.\n\nIn July 1944, test pilot Heini Dittmar reached a speed of 1,130 km/h, an unofficial airspeed record until 1953. The Me 163 began flying operational missions in 1944, defending against enemy bombing raids. Germany provided design schematics and a single Me 163 to Japan, leading to the development of the Mitsubishi J8M. By the end of the conflict, roughly 370 Komets had been completed, most of which were being used operationally.\n\nThe Me 163 was credited with the destruction of between 9 and 18 Allied aircraft against 10 losses. Many Me 163 pilots were killed during testing and training flights, partly due to the high volatility and hazard of the rocket propellant. Besides Nazi Germany, no nation ever made operational use of the Me 163, with the only other operational rocket-powered aircraft being the Japanese Yokosuka MXY-7 Ohka.",

Miles Aircraft received a contract in 1943 to produce an aircraft capable of reaching at least 1,000 mph (1,600 km/h) during level flight. The programme was ambitious and involved cutting-edge aerodynamic research and innovative design work.\n\nSecrecy surrounded the project until 1945, when the Labour government terminated it in 1946 due to budgetary reasons and skepticism regarding the practicality of supersonic aircraft. The decision was criticized, and the Ministry of Supply controversially investigated the design with scaled-down unmanned models using different wing and control surface configurations. The contract was awarded to Vickers instead of Miles.\n\nDespite the decision to end the M.52 programme, a model with the M52 configuration achieved Mach 1.38 in controlled supersonic level flight, providing some validation of the aerodynamics. Work on the afterburning version of the Power Jets W.B.2/700 turbojet was also cancelled. Miles shared the research and design with Bell Aircra",

Although it showed promise in test flights, advances in surface-to-air missile technology made the aircraft obsolete. The development programme was cancelled in 1960 after 56 test flights. Two prototypes were built, one of which is now on display at the RAF Museum Cosford.",

It was based on the experimental SR.53 but had a nose-mounted radar and more powerful engine. The German Navy also expressed interest in the project, but it was ultimately cancelled in 1957 due to changes in military policies. A larger derivative, the SR.187, was also studied but was cancelled the same year. Despite some interest, including from Japan, the project was never revived and the prototypes were eventually broken up.",

The aircraft is designed to take off from a reinforced runway and reach Mach 5.4 at 26 kilometers altitude, using the atmosphere's oxygen before switching to internal liquid oxygen to achieve Mach 25 for orbit. It can carry 17 tonnes of cargo to low Earth orbit, 11 tonnes to the International Space Station, and 7.3 tonnes to Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit. The vehicle would re-enter the atmosphere and land on a runway, undergo maintenance with a turnaround time of two days, and complete at least 200 orbital flights per vehicle. Testing of key technologies was successfully completed in 2012, allowing the project to advance to a development phase. Groundworks for an engine test facility have been completed, with plans for ground-based engine tests to begin in 2021 and uncrewed test flights by 2025. The projected cost per kilogram (kg) of payload to LEO is estimated to be reduced from the current £1,108/kg to £650/kg, with further cost reduction over time. The lifetime cost of the program was estimated to be about $12 billion in 2004, with public funding beginning in 2009, and the British government pledging £60 million to the project in 2013.",

Designed with a supersonic-capable point-defense interceptor, it was powered by a single SEPR rocket engine and augmented by wingtip-mounted turbojet engines. Two prototypes were ordered, and despite the loss of one during testing, the concept was proven feasible. The Air Force then ordered three prototype SO.9050 Trident II fighters in 1954, followed by six pre-production aircraft in 1956. Despite their record-setting performance, the progra",

        "content": "The Convair XGAM-71 Buck Duck was an air-launched decoy missile developed by Convair in the early 1950s to disrupt enemy air defenses and protect incoming bomber fleets. Convair received a development contract from the US Air Force in 1954, and the project was designated GAM-71 when put into production.\n\nThe missile was designed to have the same radar signature as the B-36 bomber and was intended to be carried in the bomb bays of the B-36. The small size of the GAM-71 allowed it to fit in the bomber's bomb bay, and it carried internal radar reflectors to mimic the B-36's radar cross-section. Glide tests of XGAM-71 prototypes began in 1955 using a modified B-29 Superfortress as the mothership, but the program was delayed due to funding issues and higher priorities for Convair.\n\nAfter seven f",

        "content": "An apogee kick motor (AKM) is a rocket motor used on satellites to provide the final push to change their orbit from a transfer orbit to a circular one. It is typically used for satellites launched into geostationary orbit. After launch, the satellite is placed in a transfer orbit with a non-zero inclination, and the AKM is used to transform this orbit into a circular one at the highest point, known as the apogee. This process, called an \"apogee kick\", brings the inclination to around zero degrees, allowing the satellite to enter a geostationary orbit. The efficiency of the AKM maneuver directly affects the amount of fuel carried on board, as fuel expenditure in this maneuver is significant. Most geostationary satellites have about half of their initial mass left after the apogee kick maneuver, with the other half being fuel expended.",

It consists of a small pressure vessel with a bar of propellant mounted on a stand. The propellant is coated to restrict the burning cross-sectional surface and ignited at one end. Wires embedded in the propellant send off electrical signals as it burns, which are recorded at different time intervals to measure the burning rate.\n\nThe burning rate measured from a strand burner is typically 4 to 12% less than the actual burning rate observed in rockets due to the differences in tem",

The concept dates back to the 1930s and offers advantages over solid and liquid rockets, such as safer propellant handling and lower mechanical complexity. Hybrid rockets are more fail-safe than other types, and their thrust is easily controllable. They offer higher theoretical specific impulse (Isp) than solid rockets but lower than liquid engines, with measurements as high as 400 s using metalized fuels. While more complex than solid rockets, hybrid",

When ordered, a rod is launched into a suborbital trajectory toward the target, designed to minimize air resistance for maximum impact velocity.\n\nThe advantage of kinetic bombardment is its ability to deliver high-speed projectiles from a high angle, making defense difficult.
