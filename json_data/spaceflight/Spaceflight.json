O'Neill that predicts a positive future for humanity 100 years from now, in contrast to other scientists' gloomy predictions. O'Neill believes that technological advancements and human potential will overcome obstacles, leading to an average American family income of $1 million/year in 2081. His research on solar power satellites and human colonies in space fuels his optimism, as he envisions these technologies providing unlimited clean energy and relieving overpopulation pressures. These colonies would be constructed from asteroid or lunar materials launched into space by mass drivers developed by O'Neill's group.",

It is planned to succeed Ariane 6 and is expected to enter service in the 2030s with the goal of halving launch costs. The rocket will have a reusable first stage landing vertically and will use an engine burning a mixture of methane and liquid oxygen, similar to the Falcon 9 rocket. Technological demonstrators for the new launcher are currently being developed.",

In 1996, it was hit by space debris from the Ariane 1 rocket, severely damaging the satellite. Despite this, new magnetic control algorithms were used to re-stabilize the satellite, allowing it to regain almost full operational mission capability. The collision also caused a minor perturbation in the orbit of the debris from the Ariane rocket.",

It was led by the French Space Agency in conjunction with the European Space Agency. The mission discovered CoRoT-7b in 2009, the first exoplanet shown to have a rock or metal-dominated composition. It was the first spacecraft dedicated to detecting transiting extrasolar planets and detected its first extrasolar planet, CoRoT-1b, in May 2007. The mission experienced a computer failure in 2012 and was retired in June 2013.",

After multiple delays, Artemis 1 was launched on November 16, 2022, and completed two flybys of the Moon before returning to Earth's atmosphere and splashing down in the Pacific Ocean on December 11. The mission aims to certify Orion and the Space Launch System for crewed flights, with Artemis 2 scheduled for a crewed lunar flyby in 2025, and Artemis 3 involving a crewed lunar landing.",

It was destroyed less than four minutes after liftoff in April 2023, breaking the record for the most powerful rocket ever flown. The flight was part of an iterative development program, and despite the destruction of the vehicle, it was regarded as having furthered Starship's development. After the test, the FAA grounded the launch program pending a mishap investigation. SpaceX submitted 63 corrective actions before another launch would be allowed. A second flight test occurred in November 2023, which did not repeat the issues of the first flight, but resulted in the loss of both vehicles.",

The test was successful in lifting off, but the booster exploded during its boostback burn and the second stage was lost due to a fire caused by excess liquid oxygen venting. However, there were no reports of public property damage or injuries. The FCC considered the launch a failure and rejected SpaceX's Starlink for large US rural broadband internet subsidies. SpaceX stated that \"success comes from what we learn\" from tests like this.",

It consists of a constellation of three spacecraft flying in an equilateral triangle formation. Originally a joint effort between NASA and ESA, the project is now solely led by ESA. The mission was formally adopted by ESA in 2024 and aims to observe gravitational waves directly, allowing scientists to study phenomena that are invisible in normal light. Potential sources for signals include merging massive black holes, binaries of compact stars, and other cosmological events.",

It was part of the Cassini-Huygens mission and named after the Dutch astronomer Christiaan Huygens. Launched in 1997, Huygens separated from the Cassini orbiter and landed on Titan in 2005, becoming the first spacecraft to land on Titan and the only one to accomplish a landing in the outer Solar System or on a moon other than Earth's. It gathered data for about 90 minutes after touchdown.",

        "content": "Ballistic capture is a low energy method for a spacecraft to achieve orbit around a distant planet or moon without using fuel to go into orbit. In the traditional alternative, spacecraft would use fuel to slow down at the target, adding cost and complexity. To achieve ballistic capture, the spacecraft is placed on a flight path ahead of the target's orbital path and then falls into the desired orbit with only minor corrections. The mathematical theory that describes ballistic capture is Weak Stability Boundary theory. It was first used by the Japanese spacecraft Hiten in 1991 and the ESA SMART-1 spacecraft in 2004.",

Object's launch altitude, inclination, and time affect inclined and sun-synchronous orbits' solar beta angles.",

        "content": "A delta-v budget is an estimate of the total change in velocity required for a space mission, calculated by summing the delta-v needed for each propulsive maneuver. It determines the propellant required for a given vehicle mass and propulsion system. Delta-v is independent of vehicle mass and additive, useful for conceptual planning of space missions. Tables of delta-v for different space regimes are helpful, and launch windows are calculated based on delta-v and launch time.",

It depends on the mass of the body and the object's distance from its center. Escape speed varies with distance, and objects on different trajectories will have different speeds. Escape velocity calculations are used to determine if an object will remain in a body's gravitational sphere of influence or escape. Rockets do not need to reach escape velocity in a single maneuver, and small forces like atmospheric drag need to be taken into account for precise trajectory calculations.",

It was popularized by Arthur C. Clarke and first used for a satellite in 1963. Communications and weather satellites are often placed in this orbit, as well as navigation satellites for GPS accuracy. Geostationary satellites are launched into a temporary orbit, then moved to a specific position and require stationkeeping to maintain it. Retired satellites are placed in a higher graveyard orbit to avoid collisions.",

It is highly elliptical, with a perigee as high as low Earth orbit (LEO) and an apogee as high as geostationary orbit. Satellites are often launched into GTO as an intermediate step before circularizing their orbit at geostationary altitude. This allows for the use of extra fuel and benefits from staging, as the launch vehicle does not need to lift the satellite and its mass to a circular geostationary altitude. Launch vehicles are often advertised based on the amount of payload they can put into GTO.",

It depends on the duration and direction of thrust, with shorter, high-thrust periods and avoiding thrusting directly against gravity minimizing losses. However, during launch and ascent, thrust must be applied over a longer period with a component against gravity, making gravity losses significant. For example, reaching a speed of 7.8 km/s in low Earth orbit requires a delta-v of 9-10 km/s, with 1.5-2 km/s attributed to gravity, steering, and atmospheric drag.",

The first spacecraft in heliocentric orbit was Luna 1 in 1959, which missed its planned impact on the Moon due to a timing error. The moons of planets in the Solar System do not follow heliocentric orbits, as they orbit their respective planet.",

Geostationary orbits are a type of equatorial orbit that allows a satellite to appear stationary to observers on Earth. Launches into equatorial orbit are especially beneficial for spacecraft with high inclinations.",

        "content": "A powered flyby, also known as an Oberth maneuver, is a maneuver in astronautics where a spacecraft falls into a gravitational well and then uses its engines to accelerate even further as it falls, gaining additional speed. This is more efficient than applying the same impulse outside of a gravitational well due to the Oberth effect, which allows a reaction engine to generate a greater change in mechanical energy at higher speeds. This means that burning fuel at the lowest orbital periapsis, when the spacecraft's orbital velocity is greatest, is the most energy-efficient method. The Oberth effect is most effective for high-thrust rocket engines, and less useful for low-thrust reaction engines. It can also help understand the behavior of multi-stage rockets and is more effective at higher speeds due to the kinetic energy of the propellant.",

This is important for low Earth orbit satellites, which are affected by non-Keplerian forces such as Earth's gravity, Sun and Moon's gravity, solar radiation pressure, and air drag. These forces can perturb the orbital plane and eccentricity, requiring active countermeasures. For geostationary spacecraft, the inclination change caused by the Sun and Moon's gravity must be counteracted, while for spacecraft in a low orbit, atmospheric drag must be compensated for. Station-keeping is also crucial for spacecraft in a halo orbit around a Lagrange point, as it is unstable and requires active control to prevent the spacecraft from leaving orbit.",

This is a more specific version of the general orbital rendezvous problem. Without obstacles, rendezvous is straightforward and efficient algorithms exist. However, when obstacles are present, the shortest or lowest-energy path may not be feasible, requiring a longer or more energy-intensive option. Maneuvering near a large orbiting object, such as a space station, is a common study area, with research focusing on departure and arrival points on the object's surface and the use of tangential departure and arrival conditions.",

In aircraft, it is common to carry less fuel for shorter trips to reduce weight and fuel consumption, leading to a similar measure called the useful load fraction. Propeller-driven airliners typically had useful load fractions of 25-35%, while modern jet airliners have higher fractions of 45-55%. For orbital rockets, the payload fraction is between 1-5%, while the useful load fraction is around 90%.",

It was initially of interest but was later explained by anisotropic radiation pressure due to the spacecraft's heat loss. The spacecraft, launched in 1972 and 1973, were found to be slowing down slightly more than expected, leading to an extremely small acceleration towards the Sun. This anomaly was first noticed in 1980 and investigated in 1994. The accepted explanation was that the spacecraft's design caused them to emit more heat in a specific direction, leading to a slight acceleration in the opposite direction. Reanalysis of thermal radiation pressure forces confirmed that this accounted for the entire anomaly, pointing to no need to update the laws of physics.",

In the patched conic approximation, the SOI marks the boundary where a trajectory switches which mass field it is influenced by. It is different from the sphere of activity, which extends beyond the SOI.",

It involved separating the Apollo Command and Service Module from the adapter, docking it with the Lunar Module, and pulling the combined spacecraft away. This created a pressurized tunnel for astronauts to transfer between the modules. The same maneuver was also used during the 1975 Apollo-Soyuz Test Project mission to extract a special docking module.",

This is mainly focused on human-made satellites in geocentric orbits. It includes procedures to prevent space debris accumulation, predicting likely collisions, and maneuvering spacecraft away from danger. The fast orbital speed around large bodies results in significant kinetic energy during collisions, making it likely that spacecraft would be critically damaged or destroyed.",

This is the fastest and most efficient way to reach the desired target orientation, with only one acceleration and braking phase for the angular rate. The rotation axis must have a time-varying torque applied to it if it is not a principal axis, and the gyroscopic effect of momentum wheels must be compensated for. The method determines the required axis of rotation and rotation angle to achieve the new orientation based on the current and desired orientation of the craft in cartesian coordinates.",

It focuses on how forces determine a vehicle's velocity and attitude over time. For aircraft, critical angles are the angle of attack of the wing and the sideslip angle of the vertical tail, which affect aerodynamic forces. Spacecraft dynamics involve propulsive, gravitational, and atmospheric forces, with gravitational forces having the most influence.",

Despite the term \"lock,\" all three gimbals can still rotate freely, but the parallel orientation prevents rotation about one axis. This problem can occur in other contexts, causing a coordinate system to lose definition of one variable at certain values of the other variables.",

For bodies with atmospheres, landers may use parachutes or landing rockets to slow down. Some landers use inflatable airbags for cushioning. When a high-velocity impact is planned for study, it is called an impactor. Terrestrial bodies such as the Moon, Venus, Mars, Mercury, Titan, asteroids, and comets have been subject to lander or impactor exploration.",

The landing point depends on factors like control, entry angle, mass, atmospheric conditions, and drag. It is possible to model the landing zone by considering multiple variables. Simulating entry under different conditions can help calculate a probable ellipse, which represents the level of uncertainty for a given confidence interval.",

In a LOR mission, a main spacecraft and a smaller lunar lander travel to lunar orbit. The lander then descends to the Moon while the main spacecraft remains in orbit. After completing the mission, the lander returns to lunar orbit to rendezvous and re-dock with the main spacecraft, and then the main spacecraft returns to Earth. Ukrainian engineer Yuri Kondratyuk first proposed LOR in 1919. Variants of LOR include sending the landers and main spacecraft separately, as proposed for other missions like the Shuttle-Derived Heavy Lift Launch Vehicle, Golden Spike, and the 2029/2030 Chinese crewed effort.",

There are two types: uncontrolled, such as space debris, and controlled, such as spacecraft. Technologies and procedures for controlled entry are collectively termed as EDL. Objects entering an atmosphere experience atmospheric drag and aerodynamic heating, which can cause loss of mass or disintegration. Reentry has been achieved with speeds ranging from 7.8 km/s to 12.5 km/s. Crewed space vehicles must be slowed to subsonic speeds before parachutes or air brakes may be deployed. Ballistic warheads and expendable vehicles do not require slowing at reentry. For Earth, atmospheric entry occurs at an altitude of 100 km, while at Venus atmospheric entry occurs at 250 km and at Mars atmospheric entry at about 80 km. Various advanced technologies have been developed to enable atmospheric reentry and flight at extreme velocities. Buoyancy is an alternative method of controlled atmospheric entry suitable for planetary entry with thick atmospheres and strong gravity.",

The rotating tether causes continuous acceleration for objects on each end, and momentum exchange occurs when an end body is released. Non-rotating tethers rotate exactly once per orbit and can exchange momentum with spacecraft. In some cases, momentum exchange systems are balanced transportation schemes with no net change in momentum or angular momentum.",

NASA estimated in 1997 that there were over 2,400 artificial satellites and more than 6,200 pieces of space debris orbiting Earth. Spacecraft enter orbit when their velocity balances the gravitational and centrifugal forces. Drag from the Earth's atmosphere can cause orbital decay, with lifetimes measured in days and hours. The escape velocity to move into interplanetary space is about 11.2 km/s.",

The radar scans a narrow strip through 360° of the celestial sphere due to Earth’s rotation. It can detect both known and unknown objects in Low-Earth Orbit (LEO), providing measurements to determine object characteristics. Radar-based beam park observations outperform optical instruments in LEO and can operate during day and night, independently of weather and object illumination. The tracking sensitivity can be improved by using a bistatic radar system.",

It includes forward contamination, which transfers life from Earth to another celestial body, and back contamination, the introduction of extraterrestrial organisms into Earth's biosphere. Microbial life and potentially invasive species are the main focus, and non-biological contamination is also a concern. Current space missions are governed by the Outer Space Treaty and COSPAR guidelines, with measures in place to prevent forward contamination through sterilization and back contamination through containment and quarantine procedures.",

It was discovered in 2002 by amateur astronomer Bill Yeung and has spectrographic evidence consistent with the titanium dioxide in the paint used on the rockets. The stage was intended to be in a permanent heliocentric orbit in 1969 but is now believed to have gone into an unstable high Earth orbit and has a 40-year cycle between heliocentric and geocentric orbit.",

The astronauts carried a total of about 641 covers, and the matter became known in 1972. The astronauts left NASA, and in 1983, a lawsuit was filed and the covers were returned in a settlement. One cover sold for over $50,000 in 2014.",

In 2019, the Astronauts Memorial Foundation voted to include private astronauts on the memorial, recognizing their contributions to the American space program. The first private astronaut added to the memorial was Michael T. Alsbury, who died in the crash of SpaceShipTwo VSS Enterprise in 2014.",

        "content": "With the arrival of robotic and human spaceflight, the U.S. Post Office started commemorating space exploration events with postage stamps. The first U.S. space vehicle was featured on a stamp in 1948, and the first issue to commemorate a space project by name was the ECHO I communications satellite in 1960. As space exploration progressed, more commemorative stamps followed, depicting satellites, space capsules, Apollo Lunar Modules, space suits, and other items. The popularity of space exploration is evident in the record numbers of First-Day covers for postage stamps with space themes, with the Project Mercury issue in 1962 receiving over three million 'First Day of Issue' cancellations. The Apollo VIII issue in 1969 received 900,000 First-Day cancellations. As U.S. space exploration continued to grow, so did the representation of space exploration on stamps.",

Some of the orbiter's instruments were reused from the failed Russian Mars 96 mission. The mission is based on the design of ESA's Rosetta and Venus Express missions, and cost about $345 million. It arrived at Mars in 2003 and is the second longest surviving spacecraft in orbit around a planet other than Earth.",

It achieved the first-ever soft landing on a comet nucleus, despite landing problems. Its instruments obtained the first images and made in-situ analysis of a comet nucleus. It entered hibernation due to reduced sunlight and a spacecraft orientation issue, and communication was sporadic before contact was lost. Its location was identified in 2016, and the Rosetta spacecraft ended its mission by crashing into the comet's Ma'at region. The lander is named after the Philae obelisk and was monitored from DLR's Lander Control Center in Cologne, Germany.",

They generate electrical current from a chemical reaction and can deliver power when the spacecraft is not in direct sunlight. Sealed to operate in a vacuum, they must withstand launch acceleration, vibration, wide temperature ranges, and must not emit gases that could harm the spacecraft. They also need to resist high ionizing radiation levels above the Earth's atmosphere for vehicles orbiting the Earth, and withstand thousands of charge and discharge cycles for satellites like communication satellites.",

These tests are used to develop procedures for mating a spacecraft to its launch vehicle, emergency access and egress, maintenance support activities, and various transportation processes. They are commonly used to test crewed spacecraft, such as the Apollo and Mercury spacecraft, the Space Shuttle Enterprise, and more recently, the Orion spacecraft for NASA's Constellation and Artemis programs.",

After pressurization, crew members clear a passage between modules by removing some CBM components and installing utility connectors. This allows for the admission of large payloads from visiting cargo spacecraft.",

It provided practical experience for scientists and NASA in managing longer experiment times. The EDO-pallet was a prominent part of the project, contracted by Rockwell International. The first orbiter with EDO hardware was Endeavour, with its last EDO flight in 1995. Columbia was also outfitted for EDO flight, while Atlantis was modified for EDO capability but never had it. The EDO-pallet used in these orbiter configurations was destroyed in the 2003 Columbia disaster.",

A volatile liquid at the hot interface turns into vapor, travels along the heat pipe, condenses at the cold interface, and then returns to the hot interface. Heat pipes have high heat transfer coefficients and are effective thermal conductors. Modern CPU heat pipes are typically made of copper and use water as the working fluid, and are commonly used in consumer electronics.",

The spacecraft's magnetic field interacts with the plasma wind to create an effective sail blocking area, accelerating the spacecraft. Different designs affect performance measures such as mass, power, force, and acceleration, enabling a comparison of magnetic sail designs. While magnetic sails have insufficient thrust to launch from Earth, they have significant thrust for travel away from Earth using the force from the solar wind, and significant thrust for deceleration in the interstellar medium.",

Each rocket used two LR-101 engines for yaw, pitch and roll control during ascent. They received propellant flow from the sustainer engine's turbopumps until shutdown, then switched to feed off remaining propellant as a Pressure-fed engine for last trajectory corrections and stabilizing the rocket before payload separation.",

It uses a laser-based 3D sensor and thermal imager, and does not rely on reference markers on the target spacecraft. Instead, it uses proprietary software to match 3D images against the known shape of the target object. TriDAR made its first demonstration space flight on Space Shuttle Discovery during the STS-128 mission in 2009, providing real-time guidance information during rendezvous and docking with the International Space Station, marking the first use of a 3D sensor \"targetless\" tracking vision system in space.",

This is necessary for spin-stabilized final stages, which require rapid rotation during firing. The mechanism is commonly used on NASA sub-orbital sounding rocket flights and was used on the Dawn spacecraft to reduce its spin rate from 46 RPM to 3 RPM. The yo-yo de-spin system was invented, built, and tested at Caltech's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. However, yo-yo hardware can contribute to the space debris problem on orbital missions, but not on earth escape missions.",

Two designs emerged, but the shuttle project rose to the top and was selected as the one major project post-Apollo. Funding for the program came into question, and NASA tried to interest the US Air Force and other customers in using the shuttle. Changes were made to lower development costs, but also lowered reusability and increased operational costs.",

In 2018, the design transitioned to stainless steel for cost, manufacturing ease, and strength reasons. The entire vehicle was renamed Starship, with the second stage called Starship and the booster Super Heavy. The design included reusable heat shield tiles and six Raptor engines. The payload to LEO was stated to be in excess of 100 t, and to GTO of 21 t in 2020.",

NASA set a goal for 2024 and decided to sole source the design to Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems, based on their assessment of the company's capabilities. Northrop offered minimalist and larger designs, ultimately opting to build the minimalist design for compatibility and expedited testing. NASA awarded Northrop a $187 million contract to complete the preliminary design of the module, and a separate contract for fabrication and integration with the Power and Propulsion Element for a total of US$935 million.",

It was launched on an Ariane 5 rocket from French Guiana in 2021 and arrived at its destination near the Sun–Earth L2 Lagrange point in 2022. The telescope is led by NASA and partnered with the European Space Agency and the Canadian Space Agency. It is named after James E. Webb, and its primary mirror consists of 18 hexagonal segments made of gold-plated beryllium. The telescope observes a lower frequency range than Hubble and must be kept extremely cold. Initial designs began in 1996, and after cost overruns and delays, it was completed in 2016 at a total cost of US$10 billion.",

It can grow up to 7 cm in diameter with a textured surface and deep cracks creating the appearance of radiating lobes. Despite its slow growth rate, it thrives in the harsh Antarctic climate and has been used in astrobiology research to study how life can adapt to extreme environments found beyond Earth.",

The cargo variant is designed to resupply the International Space Station and launch on the Vulcan Centaur rocket, while the crewed variant is planned to carry up to seven people and cargo to and from low Earth orbit. The design of the Dream Chaser is a descendant of the original NASA Space Shuttle program.",

NASA has partnered with US commercial space industry and selected three partners to develop commercial cargo transportation to the moon. The goal is to meet the demand for private activities on the moon and enable new science and exploration missions. NASA has signed three partnerships with US private sector entities and extended the agreements for 2 additional years with new milestones. They hope the companies can start delivering small payloads to the moon as early as 2018. NASA also plans to launch almost two dozen robotic missions in the next decade and commercial lunar transportation capabilities may be able to bid for these opportunities.",

Developed by Mojave Aerospace Ventures, it was funded by Paul Allen and flown by Scaled Composites. The project began in 1994, achieving supersonic flight in 2003 and the first official spaceflight in 2004. Its achievements are comparable to the X-15, with the overall project name being \"Tier One.\"",

The mission, which was intended to be the first Teacher in Space Project flight, ended in disaster 73 seconds after launch, killing all seven crew members and destroying the orbiter. An O-ring seal failure on the starboard Solid Rocket Booster was determined to be the cause of the explosion. Following the disaster, the Rogers Commission was convened by President Reagan to investigate the cause, leading to the suspension of Space Shuttle flights until safety issues were addressed. Shuttle missions resumed in September 1988 with STS-26.",

Originally scheduled for 1970, it was postponed due to the investigation following Apollo 13's failure. Commander Alan Shepard, Command Module Pilot Stuart Roosa, and Lunar Module Pilot Edgar Mitchell overcame malfunctions en route to the lunar landing. Shepard and Mitchell collected Moon rocks, deployed scientific experiments, and infamously hit golf balls on the lunar surface. Roosa remained in lunar orbit, performing experiments and taking photographs. The spacecraft successfully returned to Earth, with the astronauts splashing down safely in the Pacific Ocean on February 9.",

It aimed to award the first US-based privately funded team to design and build a reusable crewed capsule capable of transporting 5 astronauts to a Bigelow Aerospace inflatable space module. The capsule also had to be recovered and flown again within 60 days. The prize expired in 2010 without a winner or any attempted test flights, and teams had to be based in the United States.",

Founded in 1995, they participated in serious activities such as protests against the militarization of space, as well as art pranks and media spoofs. Their goal was to establish a planetary network and reclaim the idea of space travel for the common man. Members were described as Marxists, futurists, and revolutionaries. The group combined space, cyberspace, techno-music, and science fiction in their work. They participated in protests against the militarization of space and were particularly concerned about the Cassini-Huygens spacecraft.",

It originated in Southern California and was popular in the US from 1945 to the early 1970s. It was popular for roadside businesses and is now part of the mid-century modern style. Googie features upswept roofs, geometric shapes, and bold use of glass, steel, and neon. It represents American society's fascination with Space Age themes and futuristic designs. While many buildings in this style have been destroyed, some examples have been preserved, such as the oldest McDonald's stand in Downey, California.",

It was named in honor of the USS Enterprise from Star Trek and made its first powered flight in April 2013. However, it was destroyed during a powered test flight in October 2014, resulting in the death of one pilot and serious injury to another. An investigation revealed the accident was caused by premature deployment of the \"feathering\" system, and the spacecraft's design lacked fail-safe mechanisms.",

It can be used as a space station, for high-speed transportation, or space launch. The structure resists bending and can carry loads, and can be used to create a space elevator by placing a motorized platform on the cable. Different architectures, such as the launch loop, particle ring, space fountain, and tethered ring, have been proposed to address practical problems and limitations of the concept. These include using active support, controlling objects magnetically, and using tensioning tethers to raise the structure to a high altitude.",

        "content": "A rebreather is a breathing apparatus that recycles unused oxygen and inert content from exhaled breath, extending the use of limited gas supply and eliminating bubbles in underwater operations. It is used in various environments such as underwater, in space, in toxic or hypoxic environments, in high-altitude operations, and in industrial applications. The technology is used in diving, firefighting, hospital anaesthesia, high-altitude mountaineering, aerospace, submarines, spacecraft, and gas reclaim systems for helium recovery. However, it comes with technological complexity and specific hazards, and the mass and bulk may vary depending on the type and application. Electronically controlled diving rebreathers can maintain oxygen levels and integrate with decompression computers for monitoring and recording dive profiles.",
