Research has shown that such near-alignments occur more frequently by chance than expected. This challenges the belief in ley lines and other mysterious alignments as significant phenomena, suggesting they may be due solely to chance rather than supernatural or anthropological explanations. The topic has also been explored in computer vision and astronomy.\n\nMultiple studies have delved into the mathematics of aligning random points on a plane.

It is composed of photons ejected from large stars and thermal energy from exploding stars. The wind can be caused by orbital motion of gas in a galaxy cluster or by ejection from a black hole. As the wind pushes the clouds, they begin to separate and resemble ",

Nobel laureate Samuel Ting leads the project, which launched in May 2011 and has recorded over 90 billion cosmic ray events. Initial results in 2013 showed an increase in positron to electron fraction from 10 GeV to 250 GeV, with no significant variation over time or preferred incoming direction. These results, published in Physical Review Letters, are consistent with positrons originating from the annihilation of dark matter particles, but further data collection is ongoing.",

Bacteria were the first organisms studied in 1960 when a Russian satellite carried Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus, and Enterobacter aerogenes into orbit. Many microorganisms have been selected for exposure experiments since then.\n\nExperiments have shown unpredictable results, with some microorganisms weakening and others increasing in disease-causing potency. These microorganisms can be classified into two groups: human-borne and extremophiles. Studying human-borne microorganisms is important for human welfare and future crewed missions in space, while extremophiles are vital for understanding survival requirements in space.\n\nExtremophiles have adapted to extreme environments on Earth, including hypersaline lakes, arid regions, deep sea, acidic sites, and polar regions. The existence of extremophiles has led to speculation that microorganisms could survive extraterrestrial environments. Studying microorganisms in space can also help understand decontamination procedures for robotic missions to Mars.\n\nRese",

        "content": "The Wake Shield Facility (WSF) was an experimental science platform placed in low Earth orbit by the Space Shuttle. It was a 3.7 m diameter, free-flying stainless steel disk. The WSF created an ultrahigh vacuum in its wake, which was used to study epitaxial film growth. It operated at a distance from the Space Shuttle to avoid contamination and was collected by the Shuttle after two days.\n\nThe WSF was flown into space three times, proving the vacuum wake concept and growing the first-ever crystalline semiconductor thin films in the vacuum of space. These experiments have been used to develop better photocells and thin films, with potential applications such as artificial retinas made from tiny ceramic detectors.\n\nPre-flight calculations suggested a significant decrease in pressure on the wake side, but analysis of data gathered from the flights concluded a smaller decrease than expected. The WSF was sponsored by NASA's Office of Life and Microgravity Sciences and Applications and operated by the Center for Advanced Materials at the University of Houston, in conjunction with industrial partner Space Industries, Inc.\n\nAs of 2012, the WSF spacecraft is being preserved at the Center for Advanced Materials.",

These disturbances are driven by solar coronal mass ejections (CMEs) or high-speed solar wind streams. The frequency of geomagnetic storms varies with the sunspot cycle, occurring more frequently during solar maximum.\n\nSolar wind pressure initially compresses the magnetosphere, causing increased energy transfer and plasma movement. This leads to an increase in electric current in the magnetosphere and ionosphere, creating a magnetic force that pushes out the magnetosphere's boundary. Geomagnetic storms can cause various space weather phenomena such as solar energetic particle events, geomagnetically induced currents, ionospheric storms, disruptions to navigation and auroral displays.\n\nThe largest recorded geomagnetic storm, the Carrington Event in 1859, caused disruptions to the US telegraph network and fires, while a storm in 1989 disrupted power distribution in Quebec and caused aurorae as",

If an NEO's orbit crosses the Earth's, and it's over 140 meters across, it's considered potentially hazardous. Most are asteroids, with a few being comets. There are over 34,000 known near-Earth asteroids and over 120 known short-period near-Earth comets. Collisions in the past have shaped Earth's geological and biological history. Asteroids as small as 20 meters can cause significant damage. Two scales, the Torino scale and Palermo scale, rate the risk of an NEO impacting Earth. NASA has met the mandate to catalog at least 90% of NEOs over 1 kilometer in diameter. NEOs have low surface gravity and Earth-like orbits, making them accessible for spacecraft. As of April 2024, five near-Earth comets and six near-Earth asteroids have been visited by spacecraft, with samples of three returned to Earth. Preliminary plans for commercial asteroid mining have been drafted, but few have been pursued.",

They are defined as having a minimum orbit intersection distance with Earth of less than 0.05 astronomical units and an absolute magnitude of 22 or brighter, roughly corresponding to a size larger than 140 meters. As of November 2022, there are 2,304 known PHAs, with most being potentially hazardous asteroids. Only 17 of these PHAs are listed as potential threats over the next hundred years on the Sentry Risk Table. While most PHAs can be ruled out as hazardous for several hundred years, recent discoveries with little-known orbital constraints may have incomplete models until further data is collected. NASA astronomers have reported that 5 to 10 years of preparation may be needed to avoid a potential impactor.",

Physically combined, the FGS is used to point the telescope, while the NIRISS is an independent science instrument capable of exoplanet spectroscopy. The NIRISS detector is a 2048 × 2048 pixel mercury cadmium telluride (HgCdTe) array with a field of view of 2.2' × 2.2'. The FGS aids the telescope in aiming and staying pointed at targets and provides data to the JWST Attitude Control ",

Despite the telescope's main mirror defects, it produced valuable high resolution images of bright astronomical objects. Proposed by James A. Westphal and managed by JPL, the first WFPC had two separate cameras with different resolutions. In December 1993, it was replaced with an improved version as part of a corrective service mission. The original WFPC was later disassembled, with parts used in the Wide Field Camera 3, which was installed in Hubble in May 2009.",

The instrument's field of view extends from 13 to 108 degrees away from the Sun. First light image was published in September 2018, and in December, a view of the corona with a coronal streamer was released. In November 2018, a video capturing solar wind during the spacecraft's first close pass to the Sun was also released. The data collected is providing new details about solar structures and processes.",

It shares similarities with astronautical hygiene but focuses more on the biological aspects of space travel. One of its goals is to develop sustainable bioregenerative systems, known as Closed Ecological Life Support Systems (CELSS), for long duration space travel. Bioastronautics also addresses the physiological impacts of space flight on astronauts, such as bone decalcification. The field is supported by resources such as NASA's Bioastronautics Library in Houston, Texas, which contains a collection of textbooks, reference books, and academic journals related to bioastronautics topics.",

It happens because as pressure decreases, liquids boil at lower temperatures and gas increases, causing tissues to expand. This can cause injuries known as ebullism syndrome, but is generally not fatal. However, it can lead to other complications such as decompression sickness and barotrauma injuries. Astronauts and high-altitude aviators are at risk ",

Long-term weightlessness causes muscle atrophy, bone deterioration, cardiovascular system slowing, decreased red blood cell production, balance and eyesight disorders, changes in the immune system, and fluid redistribution. NASA refers to these effects as RIDGE (space radiation, isolation and confinement, distance from Earth, gravity fields, and hostile environments).\n\nEngineering problems associated with leaving Earth and developing space propulsion systems have been examined for over a century, with recent focus on how humans can survive and work in space for extended periods. A 2015 NASA health hazards report examined the impact of space exploration, including a human mission to Mars. In 2019, NASA reported long-lasting changes, including DNA and cognition alterations, in an astronaut who spent a year in space compared to his twin on Earth. Researchers in 2019 also found serious blood flow and clot problems in astronauts on the International Space Station, which may influence long-term spaceflight, including a mission to Mars.",

Exposure to radiation without Earth's magnetic field increases the risk of cancer, documented at doses over 100 mSv. Survivors of atomic bomb explosions and other studies have received radiation doses in the 50-2,000 mSv range. Space radiation is primarily composed of high-energy protons, alpha particles, and HZE ions, with distinct biological effects from radiation on Earth. Cosmic rays from outside the Milky Way are mostly energetic protons with a small component of HZE ions.",

        "content": "Before human space exploration even began, concerns were raised about the impact of microgravity on the human body, particularly the effects on skeletal muscle. Research has shown that exposure to microgravity can lead to reduced muscle strength, fatigue resistance, and motor performance, as well as changes in cardiovascular and vascular function. In the US human space program, the main in-flight countermeasure to these deficits has been physical exercise, with different protocols used on different missions. Russian scientists have also used various exercise hardware and protocols during long-duration spaceflight. On the International Space Station (ISS), a combination of resistive and aerobic exercise has been found to be effective.\n\nHowever, for future missions to the Moon, a lunar base, and Mars, it is unclear whether current countermeasures will be sufficient to meet the physical performance requirements. Research on human crewmembers during space flight is limited, so scientists have developed ground-based models to simulate the effects of microgravity on the body. These models have been useful for studying muscle unloading and sensorimotor alterations. To address these effects, researchers are exploring new countermeasures, including pharmacologic and dietary interventions, innovative exercise hardware, locomotor training devices, passive exercise devices, and artificial gravity. Recent studies have also described the hemodynamic and metabolic responses to increased loading provided by a human-powered centrifuge.",

However, experiments measuring ICP during weightless exposure have shown it to be within normal ranges. Visual changes and ICP in astronauts on long-duration flights are a recent topic of interest, with fifteen male astronauts aged 45-55 experiencing confirmed visual and anatomical changes. These include optic disc edema, globe flattening, choroidal folds, hyperopic shifts, and increased intracranial pressure. The exact cause is unknown, but it is suspected that microgravity-induced fluid shift towards the head and physiological changes play a significant role. Other contributing factors may include increased carbon dioxide (CO2) and high",

This can occur in a microgravity environment, where g-forces are nearly zero, or in a non-uniform gravitational field, such as in orbit around the Earth. In these conditions, the sensation of weight is overcome by contact forces or tidal effects. Near a black hole, these tidal effects can be very strong, leading to spaghettification. However, in the case of the Earth, the effects are minor, especially on small objects like the human body or spacecraft. This condition, known as microgravity, is prevalent in orbiting spacecraft.",

It is led by scientists, former astronauts, and engineers from various institutions. The foundation conducts research to detect NEOs that may pose a threat to Earth and develop technology to divert their path. It also assisted in establishing the International Asteroid Warning Network and a Space Missions Planning Advisory Group. The foundation had planned to launch the Sentinel Space Telescope to identify dangerous asteroids, but fundraising was unsuccessful, and the program was cancelled in 2017. The foundation is now pursuing a constellation of smaller satellites. The foundation is named after the asteroid in Antoine de Saint-Exupéry's book The Little Prince.",

The complex formation and powering of these jets are associated with high-energy astronomical sources, likely arising from interactions within accretion disks and compact central objects like black holes, neutron stars, and pulsars. Tangled magnetic fields may organize these jets, and they may also be influenced by a general relativity effect known as frame-dragging. The largest and most active jets are created by supermassive black holes in the center of active galaxies, reaching lengths of millions of parsecs. Other objects with jets include cataclysmic variable stars, X-ray binaries, gamma-ray bursts, and star forming regions. Bipolar outflows may also be associated ",

These include galaxy clusters, black holes, supernova remnants, stars, binary stars, and Solar System bodies like the Moon. All observed X-ray sources are associated with a coronal cloud or gas at coronal cloud temperatures. The combination of many unresolved X-ray sources is believed to produce the observed X-ray background, with the X-ray continuum potentially arising from bremsstrahlung, black-body radiation, synchrotron radiation, inverse Compton scattering, and atomic recombination.",

Auroras are caused by disturbances in Earth's magnetosphere from the solar wind, which results in charged particles precipitating into the upper atmosphere and emitting light. The form of the aurora depends on the amount of acceleration imparted to the precipitating particles. Auroras are also found on other planets, natural satellites, brown dwarfs, and comets.",

The corona, where the plasma is optically-thin, radiates energy and has a temperature in the millions of degrees, while the chromosphere has a lower temperature and thermal radiation. The corona's structure and dynamics are influenced by the solar magnetic field, and evidence suggests that the heating mechanism is linked to the magnetic field.\n\nThe energy flux emitted from the corona varies in different regions, with active regions emitting the most energy, followed by the quiet Sun and coronal holes. This energy flux is conducted back towards the chromosphere in a feedback process, maintaining the plasma's high temperature. The required power is a small fraction of the total solar flux but is sufficient to sustain the high temperature due to the low plasma density and different radiation proce",

It shields the solar system from cosmic ionizing radiation as part of the interplanetary magnetic field. Alexander J. Dessler likely coined the term in 1967. Heliophysics is the scientific study of the heliosphere. The solar wind extends far beyond Pluto until it encounters the termination shock, where its motion slows due to the outside pressure. The heliosheath is a transitional region between the termination shock and the heliopause, the heliosphere's outermost edge, resembling a comet in shape. The Voyager program spacecraft explored the heliosphere, with Voyager 1 encountering the heliopause in 2012 and Voyager 2 in 2018. Departing the heliosphere puts spacecraft in interstellar space.",

Research into detecting X-ray and ultraviolet radiation at high altitudes led to the launch of Goddard's rockets into the upper atmosphere in 1927. The first successful detection of solar ultraviolet radiation occurred in 1946, and X-ray solar studies began in 1949. In 1973, a solar instrument package orbited on Skylab, providing significant solar data.\n\nIn 1965, the Goddard Space Flight Center initiated a program in X-ray ast",

It produces electromagnetic radiation and causes thunder. There are three main kinds of lightning: intra-cloud, cloud-to-cloud, and cloud-to-ground. Humans have revered lightning for centuries, with idiomatic expressions across languages. The fear of lightning is called astraphobia. The first known photograph of lightning is from 1847, and evidence shows that lightning activity is influenced by air pollution. Lightning can both improve air quality and contribute to wildfires, which can in turn impact climate change. Further studies are needed to understand this relationship.",

Waves along the magnetopause respond to small-scale variations in solar wind pressure. The solar wind passes through a bow shock and forms the magnetosheath, with some plasma entering the magnetosphere and forming the plasma sheet. The amount of plasma that enters the magnetosphere is regulated by the orientation of the interplanetary magnetic field. The Sun and other stars have a solar magnetopause or heliopause where the stellar environment is bounded by the interstellar environment.",

The planet's magnetic field weakens and becomes irregular here due to interaction with the solar wind, allowing highly charged particles to penetrate. The region has lower particle density than beyond the bow shock, but greater than within the magnetopause, and is considered a transient state. Recent research suggests the magnetosheath is a dynamic region of turbulent plasma flow and may play a role in the structure of the bow shock and magnetopause, as well as the flow of energetic particles. The Earth's magnetosheath occupies the region approximately 10 Earth radii on the upwind side, extending farther out on the downwind side due to the pressure of the solar wind and varies depending on",

They are often star-forming regions, where gas, dust, and materials clump together to form denser regions that eventually become stars, with the remaining material forming planets and other objects. Most nebulae are vast in size, some being hundreds of light-years in diameter. They can appear large but not brighter from close by, with some visible to the naked eye. Many are visible due to fluorescence from hot stars and some are variably illuminated by T Tauri variable stars. Originally, the term \"nebula\" was used to describe any diffused astronomical object, including galaxies beyond the Milky Way, until the true nature of galaxies was confirmed in the early 20th century. Edwin Hubble helped categorize nebulae based on the type of light spectra they produced.",

Its baseline temperature, set by background radiation from the Big Bang, is 2.7 kelvins. The plasma between galaxies accounts for about half of the universe's ordinary matter. Intergalactic space takes up most of the universe's volume, with galaxies and star systems consisting almost entirely of empty space. The Kármán line, 100 km above sea level, is conventionally used as the start of outer space. The Outer Space Treaty, established in 1967, precludes any claims of national sovereignty and permits all states to freely explore outer space. Despite UN resolutions for peaceful uses, anti-satellite weapons have been tested in Earth orbit. \n\nThe vacuum in outer space was first proposed in the 17th century after scientists discovered that air pressure decreased with altitude. The immense scale of outer space was realized in the 20th century when the distance to the Andromeda galaxy was first measured. Humans began exploring space in the same century with high-altitude balloon flights, crewed rocket flights, and crewed Earth orbit, first achieved by Yuri Gagarin in 1961. However, the economic cost of putting objects, including humans, into space is very high, limiting human spaceflight to low Earth orbit and the Moon. Unc",

The composition of pickup ions reflects their neutral seed population and they initially have an anisotropic and toroidal velocity distribution which becomes more isotropic over time. Pickup ions then move radially outwards with the solar wind from the Sun.\n\nInterstellar pickup ions originate from the Local Interstellar Medium (LISM) with a velocity of 25 km/s, gradually ionizing",

On a time-domain plot, it appears as a high-amplitude spike, and on a spectrogram, it appears as a vertical stripe reflecting its impulsive nature. Sferics received from 2,000 kilometers or more have slightly offset frequencies, producing tweeks. When the electromagnetic energy from a sferic enters the magnetosphere, it becomes dispersed and forms a whistler signal. The whistler can be interpreted as the impulse ",

It is the site of significant transitions in the physics of the solar atmosphere, such as the dominance of gravity and dynamic forces, the ionization of helium, the opacity of the material, and the transition from gas pressure and fluid dynamics to magnetic forces.\n\nThe transition region is not well-defined in terms of a particular altitude and is challenging to study due to computational cost, uniqueness, and complexity. The ionization of helium is a crucial part of the formation of the corona, as the material cools effectively when helium is only partially ionized, but the temperature jumps rapidly to nearly one million kelvin when it becomes fully ionized. This phenomenon is called the temperature catastrophe, similar to boiling water to make steam, and is also known as evaporation. Reducing the heat causes the material to rapidly cool past the temperature catastrophe and condense. The transition region consists of material at or around this temperature catastrophe.",

It also includes trace amounts of heavy ions and atomic nuclei of elements such as carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and iron. The solar wind is influenced by the interplanetary magnetic field and varies in density, temperature, and speed over time and solar latitude and longitude. At a distance of more than a few solar radii from the Sun, the solar wind reaches supersonic speeds of 250–750 km/s. Other related phenomena include the aurora, comet tails, and geomagnetic storms.",

It radiates energy as visible light, infrared, and ultraviolet radiation, serving as the primary source of energy for life on Earth and an object of veneration in many cultures. It orbits the Galactic Center at a distance of 24,000 to 28,000 light-years and is 1 AU (1.496×108 km) or about 8 light-minutes away from Earth. The Sun's mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth, with hydrogen making up roughly three-quarters of its mass and the rest being mostly helium, oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron.\n\nFormed about 4.6 billion years ago, the Sun fuses about 600 billion kilograms of hydrogen into helium every second, converting 4 billion kilograms of matter into energy. In the distant future, the Sun will expand into a red giant, rendering Earth uninhabitable in approximately five billion years. Eventually, it will shed its outer layers and become a white dwarf, no longer producing energy through fusion but continuing to glow and give off heat from previous fusion for trillions of years. Eventually, it is theorized to become a super dense black dwarf, giving off",

They extend from about 640 to 58,000 km above the surface and trap energetic electrons and protons, protecting the atmosphere from destruction by deflecting the solar wind. Satellites in this zone must be shielded, but the Apollo astronauts passing through the belts received only a low dose of radiation. In 2013, a transient third radiation belt was detected by the Van Allen Probes, which lasted for four weeks.",

X-rays are absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere, so instruments to detect X-rays must be taken to high altitude by balloons, sounding rockets, and satellites. This field uses space telescopes that can see X-ray radiation, which standard optical telescopes cannot. X-ray emission is expected from objects with extremely hot gases, and the existence of solar X-rays was confirmed in the mid-twentieth century. Since then, many X-ray sources have been discovered, and it has been found that the intergalactic space in galaxy clusters is filled with a hot, but very dilute gas.",

Launched in 1997, it consisted of NASA's Cassini space probe and ESA's Huygens lander. Cassini made multiple flybys before entering Saturn's orbit in 2004, where it spent 13 years studying the planet, its rings, and moons. The mission ended in 2017 when Cassini was intentionally de-orbited and burned up in Saturn's atmosphere to prevent any risk of contaminating Saturn's moons. The Huygens lander successfully landed on Saturn's largest moon, Titan, making it the first landing in the outer Solar System and on a moon other than Earth's Moon. The mission far exceeded its original four-year plan, and its \"Grand Finale\" phase involved risky passes through the gaps between Saturn and its inner rings to maximize scientific results before its intentional destruction. The data collected will continue to be analyzed for many years. NASA's Planetary Science Division Director, Jim Green, described Cassini-Huygens as a \"mission of firsts\" that revolutionized our understanding of the Saturn system and where life might be found in the Solar System.",

They used nuclear reactors for power and radar to monitor NATO and merchant vessels. The satellites were placed in low Earth orbit to work effectively, as large solar panels would lead to rapid orbit decay and uselessness in Earth's shadow. Most carried BES-5 nuclear reactors, with some failures resulting in radioactive material re-entering the Earth's atmosphere. The program orbited a total of 33 reactors, with two larger TOPAZ reactors launched in 1987. The last US-A satellite was launched on 14 March 1988.",

Emphasizing uncrewed space research and commercial initiatives, the programme launched the first British satellite, Ariel 1, in 1962 using American rockets. Despite not funding the International Space Station until 2011, efforts were made in the 1960s and 1970s to develop a British satellite launch capability, resulting in the successful launch of a single satellite, Prospero, using the British rocket Black Arrow in 1971. The British National Space Centre, established in 1985 and succeeded by the UK Space Agency in 2010, aims to coordinate space-related funding and projects, including the development of a single-stage-to-orbit spaceplane called Skylon.",

It covers space exploration, liability for damage, weapons use, rescue efforts, environmental preservation, information sharing, new technologies, and ethics. Other fields of law, such as administrative, intellectual property, arms control, insurance, environmental, criminal, and commercial, are also integrated within space law.\n\nThe origins of space law date back to 1919, with international law recognizing each country's sovereignty over the airspace directly above their territory, later reinforced at the Chicago Convention in 1944. The onset of domestic space programs during the Cold War led to the official creation of international space policy, initiated by the International Council of Scientific Unions, and the passage of the Space Act in the United States, creating NASA. Since the Cold War, the Outer Space Treaty and the International Telecommunication Union have served as the legal framework for space law. The United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space and the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs are responsible for debating issues of international space law and policy.\n\nCha",

It was designed to safely bring a single astronaut from Earth orbit to the planet's surface. The compact system weighed 200 lb (91 kg) and included a rocket motor, PET film bag with ablative heat shield, foam canisters, parachute, radio equipment, and survival kit.\n\nThe astronaut would leave the vehicle in a space suit, climb inside the plastic bag, and then fill it with foam. The rocket pack would slow the astronaut's orbital speed, causing reentry into Earth's atmosphere. The foam-filled bag would provide insulation and aerobraking, and the parachute would deploy at 30,000 ft (9.1 km) to slow the fall to 17 mph (7.6 m/s). The foam heat shield would cushion the landing and act as a flotation device on water. General Electric conducted preliminary testing, but neither NASA nor the U.S. Air Force showed interest in the MOOSE system. By the late 1960s, the program had been shelved.",

The term was coined in 2003 and builds on the work of Andrew Skumanich, who found a relationship between a star's rotation and its age. Gyrochronology relies on the fact that cool, low-mass stars lose angular momentum as they age, causing their rotation periods to converge to a well-defined value. By measuring the rotation period and mass (or color) of stars in clusters of known age, the age of a large number of cool galactic field stars can be derived with 10% precision. This method is particularly useful for stars with convective envelopes and has been successfully used to estimate the ages of stars younger than one billion years.",

It began after the discovery of underground oceans in Saturn's moon Titan and Jupiter's moon Europa. The field is speculative until further missions reach the oceans beneath the rock or ice layer of the moons. Many theories exist about oceans on celestial bodies in the Solar System, from oceans made of diamond in Neptune to a gigantic ocean of liquid hydrogen under Jupiter's surface.\n\nMars and Venus are theorized to have had large water oceans early in their geologic histories. Oceans may exist beneath the surface of many dwarf planets and moons, including Europa, estimated to have over twice the water volume of Earth. The Solar System's giant planets may have liquid atmospheric layers of unknown compositions. Oceans may also exist on exoplanets and exomoons, within a circumstellar habitable zone, and ocean planets, with a surface completely covered with liquid.\n\nExtraterrestrial oceans may be composed of water or other elements and compounds. The only confirmed large stable bodies of extraterrestrial surface liquids are the lakes of Titan, made of hydrocarbons. Best-established candidates for subsurface water oceans in the Solar System are Jupiter's moons Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto; and Saturn's moons Enceladus and Titan.\n\nIn June 2020, NASA scientists reported that exoplanets with oceans may be common in the Milky Way galaxy. The inner structure of gas giants remains poorly understood. Oceans of liquid hydrogen are hypothesized",

However, some areas, especially near the poles, remain poorly imaged, and the exact locations of features are uncertain. Today, selenography is considered part of selenology, or lunar science, and the word comes from the Greek words for Moon and to write",

The Sun and planets make up over 99.86% of the Solar System's mass, with the remaining mass mainly in Jupiter and Saturn. Additionally, there are at least nine dwarf planets and numerous small bodies like asteroids and comets. The heliosphere, formed by the Sun's solar wind, marks the boundary to interstellar space, and the Oort cloud is the theorized outermost region. The Solar System's closest star, Proxima Centauri, is 4.25 light-years away, and both stars belong to the Milky Way galaxy.",

Theorists create models and use observational results to determine the best model. Modern theoretical astronomy began with Johannes Kepler's work and spans from the late 16th century to the late 19th century. It builds on observational astronomy, astrometry, astrochemistry, and astrophysics, and uses computational techniques to model celestial mechanics and formation. Most theoretical astronomy relies on Newtonian theory, as general relativity effects are weak for most celestial objects. It focuses on analyzing the periodic motions of celestial objects rather than predicting the characteristics of every object in the universe.",

It is formed when a mass is compacted enough to deform spacetime. The boundary from which no escape is possible is called the event horizon. Crossing it has a huge impact on the fate of the object, but no local features can be detected. Black holes reflect no light and emit Hawking radiation, making them essentially impossible to observe due to their extremely low temperature.",
