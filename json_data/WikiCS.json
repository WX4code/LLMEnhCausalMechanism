Initially, the company had projected mining asteroids for precious metals, which brought it into the limelight by developing and deploying the technologies for asteroid mining. Following financial troubles caused by \"delayed investment”, it was announced on 31 October 2018, that the company's human assets were purchased by the blockchain software technology company ConsenSys, Inc.[4] In May 2020, ConsenSys made all Planetary Resources intellectual property available to the public domain, and in June 2020, all the remaining hardware assets were auctioned off.[5]Although the long-term goal of the company is to mine asteroids, its initial plans call for developing a market for small (30–50 kg) cost-reduced space telescopes for Earth observation and astronomy. These spacecraft would employ a laser-optical system for ground communications,[6] reducing payload bulk and mass compared to conventional RF antennas.[not verified in body] The deployment of such orbital telescopes was envisioned as the first step forward in the company's asteroid mining ambitions. The same telescope satellite capabilities that Planetary Resources hope to sell to customers could be used to survey and intensively examine near-Earth asteroids.Planetary has to date launched two test satellites to orbit. Arkyd 3 Reflight (A3R) was launched and successfully transported to Earth orbit on 17 April 2015 and was deployed from the International Space Station via the NanoRacks CubeSat Deployer on 16 July 2015.[7][8]Arkyd 6, the company's second satellite, was successfully placed into orbit on 11 January 2018.[9]"

Hughes, and the 601 platforms, were acquired by Boeing in 2000. The last commercial 601 satellite was ordered in 2001 and launched in 2004. The NASA Space Communications and Navigation (SCaN) Program Office in December 2007 selected the BSS-601HP for its third generation TDRS spacecraft, adding the two 15-foot (4.5m) diameter steerable antennas. The TDRS-M satellite, launched on August 18, 2017, became the last 601 satellite to reach orbit.",

    "content": "On 11 January 2007, China conducted an anti-satellite missile test. A Chinese weather satellite\\u2014the FY-1C (COSPAR 1999-025A) polar orbit satellite of the Fengyun series, at an altitude of 865 kilometres, with a mass of 750 kilograms was destroyed by a kinetic kill vehicle traveling with a speed of 8\\u00a0km/s  in the opposite direction[2] (see Head-on engagement). It was launched with a multistage solid-fuel missile from Xichang Satellite Launch Center or nearby.Aviation Week & Space Technology magazine first reported the test on 17 January 2007.[3] The report was confirmed on 18 January 2007 by a United States National Security Council (NSC) spokesperson.[4] The Chinese government did not publicly acknowledge that the test had occurred until 23 January 2007 when the Chinese Foreign Ministry issued a statement confirming the test.[5] China claims it formally notified the US, Japan and other countries about the test in advance.It was the first known successful satellite intercept test since September 1985, when the United States destroyed the Solwind P78-1 satellite with ASM-135 anti-satellite missile released by a F-15 Eagle flying at a speed of Mach 0.934 and an altitude of 38. The satellite was orbiting at 345\\u00a0miles (555\\u00a0km).[7][8][9],The New York Times,[10] The Washington Times[11] and Jane's Intelligence Review[12] reported that the Chinese test came after at least two direct ascent tests that intentionally did not result in an intercept, on 7 July 2005 and 6 February 2006.[13],A leaked classified diplomatic cable indicates that the same system was tested against a ballistic target in January 2010[14] in what the Chinese government publicly described as a test of ground-based midcourse missile interception technology\\\".[15] That description also closely matches the Chinese government's description of another test in January 2013,[16] which has led some analysts to conclude that it was yet another test of the same ASAT system, again against a ballistic target and not a satellite.[17]",

The test made India the fourth country after the United States, Russia and China to have tested an ASAT weapon.The test sparked concerns regarding the creation of space debris. The Indian government tried to address these concerns by saying that the debris generated from the test would not last for a long duration.India's successful demonstration of the ASAT capability is said to signify its ability to intercept an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM).

It was the only Discovery mission to fail.The two comets scheduled to be visited were Encke and Schwassmann-Wachmann-3, and the third target was d'Arrest. It was hoped that a new comet would have been discovered in the inner Solar System between 2006 and 2008, in which case the spacecraft trajectory would have been changed if possible to rendezvous with the new comet. Scientific objectives included imaging the nuclei at resolutions of up to 4 meters , performing spectral mapping of the nuclei at resolutions of up to 100 meters, and obtaining detailed compositional data on gas and dust in the near-nucleus environment, with the goal of improving knowledge of the characteristics of comet nuclei.After the solid rocket motor intended to inject the spacecraft into solar orbit was ignited on August 15, 2002, contact with the probe could not be re-established. Ground-based telescopes later found three objects along the course of the satellite, leading to the speculation that it had disintegrated. Attempts to contact the probe were ended on December 20, 2002. The probe thus accomplished none of its primary scientific objectives, but did prove some spaceflight technologies, such as the APL-developed non-coherent Doppler tracking spacecraft navigation technique, which was later used on the New Horizons spacecraft.[1][2]",

The missions of the Mariner 1 and 2 spacecraft are sometimes known as the Mariner R missions. Original plans called for the probes to be launched on the Atlas-Centaur, but serious developmental problems with that vehicle forced a switch to the much smaller Agena B second stage. As such, the design of the Mariner R vehicles was greatly simplified. Far less instrumentation was carried than on the Soviet Venera probes of this period—for example, forgoing a TV camera—as the Atlas-Agena B had only half as much lift capacity as the Soviet 8K78 booster. The Mariner 2 spacecraft was launched from Cape Canaveral on August 27, 1962, and passed as close as 34,773 kilometers (21,607 mi) to Venus on December 14, 1962.[4]",

The launch took place at 23:22:00 UTC on 8 February 1985.[3] It was the first Spacebus satellite to be launched. Immediately after launch, one of its solar panels failed to deploy, resulting in reduced performance. It was placed into a geosynchronous orbit at a longitude of 19.0 East.[4] Following a series of gyroscope malfunctions, it was retired from active service, and remained operational as a backup.[2][5] In September 1991, another problem developed with the spacecraft's attitude control system, and it began to drift eastward. It failed completely in March 1992.[6]",

Discovery was launched from LC-39A at the Kennedy Space Center at 11:33:00 GMT on 17 June 1985.[2] It was deployed from Discovery, and boosted to a geosynchronous transfer orbit by means of a PAM-D upper stage. Sultan bin Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud flew aboard the Shuttle to supervise deployment, becoming the first Saudi citizen and first member of royalty to fly in space. Morelos 1 and Telstar 303 were also deployed on the same mission.Arabsat 1B was placed into a geosynchronous orbit at a longitude of 26° East.[3] In October 1991, a problem developed with the spacecraft's attitude control system, causing it to drift eastward out of control.[4] The same fault had developed aboard its sister satellite, Arabsat-1A, a month earlier.[5] It failed completely in early 1992.[4]",

(The last in the series was spin-stabilized). Instruments included particle detectors of varying types, magnetometers, and photometers for observing auroras.[1] The last three satellites were launched as part of the Explorer program of the NASA.In spite of various hardware difficulties and the loss of Injun 2 due to an upper stage failure, the program was generally successful. In particular, they produced data on the Van Allen radiation belts including electrical convection in the magnetosphere,[2] and the radiation after effects of the Starfish Prime high-altitude nuclear test.[3]",

It was based on the Syncom series of satellites that Hughes had previously built for NASA to demonstrate that communications via synchronous-orbit satellite were feasible. Its booster was a Thrust Augmented Delta (Delta D).

It was launched 17 March 1958. Vanguard 1 was the first satellite to have solar electric power.[4] Although communications with the satellite were lost in 1964, it remains the oldest human-made object still in orbit, together with the upper stage of its launch vehicle.[1],Vanguard 1 was designed to test the launch capabilities of a three-stage launch vehicle as a part of Project Vanguard, and the effects of the space environment on a satellite and its systems in Earth orbit. It also was used to obtain geodetic measurements through orbit analysis.[5] Vanguard 1, being small and light enough to carry with one hand, was described by the Soviet Premier, Nikita Khrushchev, as the grapefruit satellite.[6]  ",

The ship could work in real time mode (one data frame per second) or in data recording mode (one frame every 256 seconds). The first mode was used for the first 40% of the mission's duration. About 1 transmission was received every 4 hours. The second mode was used until the next pair of Vela satellites were launched.The ship remains in orbit around Earth.",

The satellites form the space segment component of the overall EUMETSAT Polar System (EPS), which in turn is the European half of the EUMETSAT / NOAA Initial Joint Polar System (IJPS). The satellites carry a payload comprising 11 scientific instruments and two which support Cospas-Sarsat Search and Rescue services. In order to provide data continuity between Metop and NOAA Polar Operational Environmental Satellites (POES), several instruments are carried on both fleets of satellites.\nMetop-A, launched on 19 October 2006, is Europe's first polar orbiting satellite used for operational meteorology. With respect to its primary mission of providing data for Numerical Weather Prediction, studies have shown that Metop-A data are measured as having the largest impact of any individual satellite platform on reducing 24-hour forecasting errors, and accounts for about 25% of the total impact on global forecast error reduction across all data sources.[1]Each of the three satellites were originally intended to be operated sequentially, however good performance of the Metop-A and Metop-B satellites mean there was a period of all three satellite operating.  EUMETSAT lowered the orbit of Metop-A and decommissioned the spacecraft in November 2021 [2]",

Its conception is a direct response to an increasing number of large satellite internet constellations outside of the control of the EU, such as Starlink, OneWeb or the forthcoming Kuiper project.[4] The total cost of the programme is estimated at €6 billion,[5][6][7][8][9] to which the European Union itself will contribute €2.4 billion from 2022 until 2027.[10][11]\nIn addition to its use for communications, there are also plans to use IRIS² for space surveillance, and to detect high-altitude spy balloons.[12]\nIRIS² is part of an overall EU space strategy that will include the forthcoming EU Space Strategy for Security and Defence.[13]\nThe project was first announced by the Council of the EU in November 2022.[1] A single multi-national industrial consortium, including Airbus Defence and Space, Thales Alenia Space and Arianespace among others, is expected to carry it out.[14][15] The constellation is expected to be launched by European rockets such as the upcoming Ariane 6. The latter's first launch, initially scheduled for the end of the year 2022, is expected to take place in summer 2024 after several delays.[16][17][18] In case of further hiccups, foreign contractors, namely SpaceX, may be considered.\nIn January 2024, it was reported European space giants were putting the final touches on a common proposal for the sovereign broadband constellation amid the looming mid-February deadline to submit their best and final offer to the European Commission.[19] The contract was originally scheduled to be awarded by the end of March but the European Commission appears to have put it on hold. At a meeting of an EU parliamentary committee on April 9 2024, EU commissioner for the internal market, Thierry Breton, stated the commission was still working on finalizing the contract without providing an estimate regarding when it would be completed.[20]",

    "content": "Starlink is a satellite internet constellation operated by Starlink Services, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of American aerospace company SpaceX,[3] providing coverage to over 70 countries. It also aims to provide global mobile broadband.[4]\nSpaceX started launching Starlink satellites in 2019. As of early March 2024, it consists of over 6,000 mass-produced small satellites in low Earth orbit (LEO)[5] that communicate with designated ground transceivers. Nearly 12,000 satellites are planned to be deployed, with a possible later extension to 34,400. SpaceX announced reaching more than 1 million subscribers in December 2022,[6] 2 million subscribers in September 2023,[7] and 3 million subscribers in May 2024.[8]\nThe SpaceX satellite development facility in Redmond, Washington houses the Starlink research, development, manufacturing and orbit control facilities. In May 2018, SpaceX estimated the total cost of designing, building and deploying the constellation would be at least US$10 billion.[9] Revenues from Starlink in 2022 were reportedly $1.4 billion accompanied by a net loss, with a small profit being reported starting in 2023.[10] Revenue is expected to reach $6.6 billion in 2024.[11]\nStarlink has been extensively used in the Russo-Ukrainian War, a role for which it has been contracted by the United States Department of Defense.[12] Starshield, a military version of Starlink, is designed for government use.[13][14]\nAstronomers have raised concerns about the effect the constellation may have on ground-based astronomy, and how the satellites will contribute to an already congested orbital environment.[15][16] SpaceX has attempted to mitigate astronometric interference concerns with measures to reduce the satellites' brightness during operation.[17] They are equipped with Hall-effect thrusters allowing them to orbit raise, station-keep, and de-orbit at the end of their lives. They are also designed to autonomously and smoothly avoid collisions based on uplinked tracking data.[18]",

'Global Navigation Satellite System') is a Russian satellite navigation system operating as part of a radionavigation-satellite service. It provides an alternative to Global Positioning System (GPS) and is the second navigational system in operation with global coverage and of comparable precision.\nSatellite navigation devices supporting both GPS and GLONASS have more satellites available, meaning positions can be fixed more quickly and accurately, especially in built-up areas where buildings may obscure the view to some satellites.[1][2][3] GLONASS supplementation of GPS systems also improves positioning in high latitudes (north or south).[4]\nDevelopment of GLONASS began in the Soviet Union in 1976. Beginning on 12 October 1982, numerous rocket launches added satellites to the system until the completion of the constellation in 1995. In 2001, after a decline in capacity during the late 1990s, the restoration of the system was made a government priority, and funding increased substantially. GLONASS is the most expensive program of the Roscosmos, consuming a third of its budget in 2010.\nBy 2010, GLONASS had achieved full coverage of Russia's territory. In October 2011, the full orbital constellation of 24 satellites was restored, enabling full global coverage. The GLONASS satellites' designs have undergone several upgrades, with the latest version, GLONASS-K2, launched in 2023.[5]\nIn 2020, Glonass-BDD LLC checked the information system for analyzing and preventing traffic accidents and published a digital safety rating for 3,000 km of Russian roads.[6][7]",

Within the Dvorak satellite strength estimate for tropical cyclones, there are several visual patterns that a cyclone may take on which define the upper and lower bounds on its intensity. The primary patterns used are curved band pattern (T1.0-T4.5), shear pattern (T1.5–T3.5), central dense overcast (CDO) pattern (T2.5–T5.0), central cold cover (CCC) pattern, banding eye pattern (T4.0–T4.5), and eye pattern (T4.5–T8.0).",

The passage of typhoons, hurricanes, as well as other tropical cyclones have been detected by word of mouth from sailors recently coming to port or by radio transmissions from ships at sea, from sediment deposits in near shore estuaries, to the wiping out of cities near the coastline. Since World War II, advances in technology have included using planes to survey the ocean basins, satellites to monitor the world's oceans from outer space using a variety of methods, radars to monitor their progress near the coastline, and recently the introduction of unmanned aerial vehicles to penetrate storms. Recent studies have concentrated on studying hurricane impacts lying within rocks or near shore lake sediments, which are branches of a new field known as paleotempestology. This article details the various methods employed in the creation of the hurricane database, as well as reconstructions necessary for reanalysis of past storms used in projects such as the Atlantic hurricane reanalysis.",

It was the first DMC satellite to be launched of the five to seven that are planned. The DMC was the first satellite constellation designed for that objective. The launch took place on 28 November 2002 from the Plesetsk Cosmodrome in northern Russia on a Kosmos-3M launcher in -20 degree Celsius weather. It completed its mission after seven years and nine months in August 2010. The satellite was designed to operate for five years.[5]AlSat-1 is built on the SSTL-100 platform. The onboard instrumentation consists of two banks with three Earth imaging cameras each that, in total, has a resolution of 32 meters in three spectral bands (NIR, red, and green). The imaging swath of the cameras is 600 km. The satellite was constructed in a fifteen-month time period by the British and Algerians, of which eleven Algerian engineers were trained by SSTL.[6] The satellite uses resistojets for propulsion, and butane as its propellant. The resistojets provide more than 20 m/s of delta velocity.[2]",

Its stated goal is to expand Earth's natural resource base[3] by developing and deploying the technologies for asteroid mining. Following financial troubles caused by delayed investment, it was announced on 31 October 2018, that the company's human assets were purchased by the blockchain software technology company ConsenSys, Inc.[4] In May 2020, ConsenSys made all Planetary Resources intellectual property available to the public domain, and in June 2020, all the remaining hardware assets were auctioned off.[5]Although the long-term goal of the company is to mine asteroids, its initial plans call for developing a market for small (30–50 kg) cost-reduced space telescopes for Earth observation and astronomy. These spacecraft would employ a laser-optical system for ground communications,[6] reducing payload bulk and mass compared to conventional RF antennas.[not verified in body] The deployment of such orbital telescopes was envisioned as the first step forward in the company's asteroid mining ambitions. The same telescope satellite capabilities that Planetary Resources hope to sell to customers could be used to survey and intensively examine near-Earth asteroids.\nPlanetary has to date launched two test satellites to orbit.  Arkyd 3 Reflight (A3R) was launched and successfully transported to Earth orbit on 17 April 2015 and was deployed from the International Space Station via the NanoRacks CubeSat Deployer on 16 July 2015.[7][8]Arkyd 6, the company's second satellite, was successfully placed into orbit on 11 January 2018.[9]",

Total cost of the satellite is 270 million US dollars.[5]\n\nARSAT-1 carries a total of 24 IEEE Ku band (NATO J-band) transponders. Twelve will be operating at 36 MHz, eight at 54 MHz and four at 72 MHz, for a total bandwidth of 1152 MHz.[6] It will offer a wide range of telecommunications, data transmission, telephone and television services mainly across all of Argentina, Chile, Uruguay and Paraguay including direct broadcast TV in the ISDB-S standard.[7][8]\n\nDescription\nThe ARSAT-1 is the first flight model of the ARSAT-3K satellite bus developed by INVAP for ARSAT S.A.[9] It is a small (around 3 t (3.3 tons) at launch) platform with a 350 kg (770 lb) maximum payload mass and 3.5 kW of payload power consumption at the satellite end of life. It uses an integrated chemical propulsion system supplied by EADS Astrium for both orbit raising and station keeping.[9]\n\nThe satellite uses a Ku band communication payload which was supplied by Thales Alenia Space. It is a composed of twelve 36 MHz transponders, eight of 54 MHz and four of 72 MHz, for a total bandwidth of 1152 MHz or 32 TPE.[6]",

It was launched in 2012 as a replacement for the Apstar 2R satellite launched in 1997.[3]\n\nApstar-7 was constructed by Thales Alenia Space, and is based on the Spacebus-4000C2 satellite bus. The satellite had a mass at launch of 5,054 kilograms (11,142 lb), and is expected to operate for at least 15 years.[1] It is positioned in geostationary orbit at a longitude of 76.5 degrees East, and carries 56 transponders with an operating power of 8.4 kilowatts;[1] 28 operating in the C band and providing services to Asia, Africa, eastern and central Europe and Australia and the other 28 operating in the Ku band, covering Africa, the Middle East, China, and Taiwan.[4] The satellite's solar arrays generate 11.4 kilowatts of power.\n\nApstar-7 was launched by a Long March 3B/E carrier rocket, flying from Launch Complex 2 at the Xichang Satellite Launch Centre. Liftoff took place at 10:27 UTC on 31 March 2012, with the rocket placing the satellite into a supersynchronous transfer orbit.[5]",
