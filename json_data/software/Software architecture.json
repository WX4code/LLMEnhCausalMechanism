When the tool's conventions match the desired behavior, there is no need for configuration files. Ruby on Rails specifically focuses on project file and directory structures, streamlining development by eliminating the need for XML configuration files commonly found in older frameworks.",

This concept posits that the social boundaries within organizations shape the technical structure of their products, as communication between different parts is essential for compatibility. In essence, complex products end up mirroring the organizational structure in which they were developed. While initially focused on software architecture, Conway's law can be applied to various technical fields, emphasizing the impor",

Traditionally, marker interfaces are used for runtime verification, but design markers go beyond this to document design choices in Java programs using Javadoc documentation. \n\nDesign choices that can't be directly expressed in languages like C# and Java must be implemented through programming and naming conventions. This can lead to erosion of design investments over time and create a false segregation between designers and implementers. The Design Markers technique, utilizing standard Javadoc-like tools, offers a way to address these issues and reap the benefits of Explici",

Various methodologies like domain specific languages and feature tables are used to create domain models, which serve as the basis for developing software architectures and applications. In information science, domain analysis refers to the study of specific knowledge domains, proposed in 1995 by Birger Hjørland and H. Albrechtsen.",

It involves dividing a large system into bounded contexts, each with its own model. The structure and language of code should reflect the business domain, such as classes like \"loan application\" and methods like \"accept offer.\" DDD aims to prioritize the core domain and domain logic layer, base designs on the domain model, and involve collaboration between technical and domain experts to refine the model. Critics argue that DDD requires isolation and encapsulation to maintain the model, but it offers benefits like maintainability. The term was coined by Eric Evans in his 200",

The process involves creating models to communicate system designs in a more understandable way for users. By decreasing the \"semantic gap\" between the system and the real world, modeling helps ensure the appropriate system structure. OOM also allows for abstraction, focusing on the functionality of the system before considering implementation details. This approach is typically done using UML, which includes use cases and abstract object definitions.",

This approach allows for declarative definition of infrastructure requirements, with the ability to change functionalities by simply replacing software. Software-defined equipment (SDE) or apparatus (SDA) includes tools like software-defined radio, network, and television, with embedded systems benefitting from direct firmware updates (DFU) via over-the-air (OTA) actions.\n\nSDI/SDA/SDE reduces infrastructure maintenance efforts, enables focus on other software aspects, ensures consistency and extensibility, allows for remote deployment without downtime, and leverages versioning capabilities like git. The flexibility of these systems lies in the ability to adapt configurations without disruption, transitioning seamlessly between different functionalities through automated state changes. This leads to cost savings through the use of a single hardware for multiple tasks and increased flexibility in hardware utilization.",

A top-down approach involves breaking down a system into subsystems starting with an overview and progressing to more detailed levels, often using black boxes for simplicity. In contrast, a bottom-up approach involves piecing together systems to create more complex ones, with information processed based on incoming data to form perceptions. While top-down starts with the big picture and breaks down, bottom-up begins with detailed base elements that are linked to form larger subsystems and eventually a complete system. Organic strategies may lead to a tangle of elements and subsystems optimized locally rather than globally.",

The logical view focuses on functionality, the process view deals with dynamic aspects, the development view is from a programmer's perspective, and the physical view shows the system from a system engineer's point of view. Scenarios are used to illustrate the architecture. The model is not tied to any specific notation, tool, or design method. It is a generic approach that can be adapted to different needs and preferences.",

Proposed integration methods include message routing and communication protocols through middleware systems. Many A.I. systems already integrate technologies like speech synthesis and recognition, but there is increasing focus on integration as a standalone field. Researchers like Marvin Minsky, Aaron Sloman, and others advocate for this approach, as integrating existing A.I. systems is seen as a more logical path to broader A.I. capabilities than building new sy",

High cohesion is preferable, leading to robustness, reliability, reusability, and understandability. In contrast, low cohesion can make software difficult to maintain, test, reuse, or understand. High cohesion is often linked with loose coupling, which reduces maintenance and modification costs. Larry Constantine introduced cohesion and coupling in the late 1960s as part of Structured Design to promote \"good\" programming practices. These concepts were later standard terms in software engineering.",

CLIs originated in the 1960s as a user-friendly alternative to punched cards. While most users now prefer graphical interfaces, many programs still rely on CLIs. Knowledge of CLIs is useful for scripting and automation. CLIs are enabled by command-line interpreters, which process and execute commands. Alternatives to CLIs include GUIs like Microsoft Windows, text-based menus like DOS Shell, and keyboard shortcuts.",

        "content": "In software engineering, dependency injection is a programming technique that separates the construction of objects from their use, making programs more loosely coupled. Instead of creating objects internally, objects or functions receive their dependencies from external code, improving flexibility and maintainability. Dependency injection helps address issues such as object independence and supporting different configurations. \n\nIn statically typed languages, dependency injection allows clients to declare interfaces of services rather than concrete implementations, enabling easier runtime changes without recompiling. Application frameworks often combine dependency injection with inversion of control, where the framework constructs an object and its dependencies, then passes control flow to it. \n\nDependency injection implements the concept of \"inverting control over implementations of dependencies,\" which some Java frameworks refer to as \"inversion",

Instead of directly invoking procedures, components announce events that other components can register interest in by associating a procedure. When an event is announced, all registered procedures are invoked. This technique is the foundation of the observer pattern",

        "content": "In software engineering, inversion of control (IoC) is a design principle where custom code receives control flow from a generic framework. This approach differs from procedural programming, where the program's code calls reusable libraries. IoC has been widely used in application development frameworks, particularly in GUI and web server environments, making frameworks extensible for application programmers.\n\nEvent-driven programming often utilizes IoC, allowing custom code to focus on event handling while the framework or runtime environment manages event loop and dispatch. In web server frameworks, dispatch is commonly referred to as routing and handlers as endpoints. In the Java community, IoC is associated with injecting objects' dependencies using \"IoC containers\" in frameworks like Spring, giving the framework control over dependency implementations rather than ",

Pawson later applied the pattern to Functional Programming, creating a variant called Naked Functions.",

Nodes have inputs and outputs, linking to execute tasks. UI displays graph visually using GPU rendering. Nodes are often rectangles connected by lines. Originating in the 1960s, it is widely used in graphics, games, and machine learning. Some praise its abstraction for usability, while others find visual programming restrictive and resort to code modifications.",

Unlike MVC, PAC is structured hierarchically with agents communicating through control parts. Each agent consists of a triad that isolates presentation and abstraction. This allows for separate multithreading of the model and view, reducing program start times by displaying the user interface before the abstraction is fully initialized.",

It emphasizes uniform interfaces, independent component deployment, and scalability. REST promotes a layered architecture for caching, security, and encapsulating legacy systems. It has been widely used in creating stateless, reliable web applications. The term \"RESTful\" is often associated with HTTP-based APIs and best practices for resource handling, but may not align with the original principles of REST.",

Similar to monetary debt, if technical debt is left unpaid, it can accumulate interest, making it difficult to implement changes and increasing software entropy and rework costs. While technical debt can sometimes be necessary to move projects forward, experts warn against minimizing its impact, which can lead to insufficient prioritization of needed corrections.\n\nAs changes are made to a codebase, there may be additional changes required in other areas, creating a form of debt that must be repaid to avoid accumulating more interest. This can make project development cumbersome. Although the term is commonly used in software development, it can also be relevant in other professions.\n\nIn a 2016 Dagstuhl s",

This pattern is often used in object persistence tools and ORM, with foreign key relationships represented as object instances.",

This supports the single responsibility principle by isolating application data access needs from specific DBMS implementation. Traditionally associated with Java EE and relational databases, the DAO can be found in the Data Access layer of the 3-Tier Architecture. Implementation options include one DAO for each table, one DAO for all tables in a DBMS, limited SELECT queries for target tables, and unrestricted SELECT queries allowed by the DBMS.",

It involves using abstract interfaces for API calls between components, increasing modularity and maintainability. However, it does not guarantee low coupling or high cohesion. This approach is useful for third parties or different teams developing components for an existing system. For example, Eclipse IDE uses interface-based programming, where plugin vendors must meet interface specifications provided by the parent application. This allows for easy integration of new components and plugins while maintaining compatibility with the existing system.",

The viewmodel acts as a value converter, exposing data objects from the model in a manageable way for the view. It implements a mediator pattern to organize access to back-end logic based on supported use cases. MVVM is a variation of Martin Fowler's Presentation Model pattern and was developed by Microsoft architects Ken Cooper and Ted Peters to simplify event-driven programming of user interfaces. It is commonly used in Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) and Silverlight. Other implementations, such as ZK and KnockoutJS, refer to it as model–view–binder.",

It is ideal for system integration and software design, providing functionality remotely and independently. SOA is vendor, product, and technology agnostic. A service in SOA represents a repeatable business activity with a specified outcome, is self-contained, acts as a black box for consumers, and may be composed of other services. Different services can be combined as a service mesh to create large software applications, similar to modular programming.\n\nSOA integrates distributed software components through technologies and standards that enable communication and cooperation over a network. It is related to APIs, which simplify software implementation and maintenance by providing interfaces between different program parts. It's important to note that SOA is distinct from Service-Based Architecture.",

It serves as the foundation for Microsoft technologies like OLE, ActiveX, and COM+. COM allows for the reuse of objects without knowledge of their internal workings, with well-defined interfaces separated from implementation. Objects manage their own creation and destruction through reference-counting, and type conversion is achieved through the QueryInterface method. COM is implemented only on Microsoft Windows and Apple's Core Foundation 1.3 and later, with .NET framework and WCF replacing it in some applications. Despite similarities to CORBA and Enterprise JavaBeans, COM provides a stable ABI for object-oriented C++ libraries, making it attractive for use in cross-compiler environments.",

DCE/RPC plays a key role in DCOM, ensuring strict rules for marshalling and memory management. DCOM competed with CORBA as a model for code and service-reuse over the Internet. However, challenges with firewalls and security led to HTTP requests and web browsers becoming more popular. DCOM was launched as a beta for Windows 95 in 1996 and is supported in all versions of Windows since Windows 95 and Windows Server since NT 4.0.",

ICU provides various services including Unicode text handling, character properties, language-sensitive collation, normalization, locale data, and time zone support. ICU 73.2 includes improved support for Chinese GB18030-2022 compliance and other changes, while ICU 74 brings updates to Unicode 15.1 and CLDR 44, including new characters, emoji, security mechanisms, and significant locale data improvements. Other changes in ICU 74 include enhanced language support, a new spoof checker API, and updates to person name formatting. Future versions of ICU will require more recent programming language standards, including C++17 or C11.",

CouchDB uses MVCC to handle writes without locking the database, leaving conflict resolution to the application. Features include ACID semantics, (incremental) MapReduce, and replication, with multi-master replication for scalability. Fauxton (formerly Futon) is a built-in web application for administration.",

They share data and communicate by invoking methods, often using remote method invocation through message-passing. This allows objects in different locations to work together seamlessly. Distributed objects were popular in the late 1990s and early 2000s but have since become less common. The term can also refer to extended object concepts like replicated objects, which maintain consistency between replicas, and live distributed objects, which may have weaker consistency between replicas. Live distributed objects run instances of distributed protocols and encapsulate distributed state and behavior.",

This concept can be compared to social media as a public utility. Participating websites are interoperable and communicate over social networking protocols. Software for distributed social networking is portable and can be easily adopted on different platforms. Distributed social networks differ from social network aggregation services, which manage accounts across multiple networks. Some providers offer distributable services through widgets or plug-ins for users' websites.",

        "term": "MapReduce",
        "content": "MapReduce is a programming model and implementation for processing big data sets using parallel, distributed algorithms on a cluster. It consists of a map procedure for filtering and sorting, and a reduce method for summary operations. The \"MapReduce System\" orchestrates processing by marshalling distributed servers, running tasks in parallel, managing communications and data transfers, and providing redundancy. The model is a specialization of the split-apply-combine strategy for data analysis and is inspired by the map and reduce functions in functional programming. Its key contributions are scalability and fault-tolerance achieved through parallelization. MapReduce libraries have been written in many programming languages, with different levels of optimization. A popular implementation is part of Apache Hadoop. By 2014, Google was no longer using MapReduce as their primary big data processing model, and development had moved on to more capable and less disk-oriented mechanisms.",

The system propagates data modifications and resolves conflicts. This is in contrast to primary-replica replication, where only a single \"master\" can modify data, and failover clustering, where passive replica servers prepare to take over if the master fails. Multi-master systems often use Consensus algorithms for communication and replication. The main purposes are increased availability and faster server response time.",

        "content": "Parasitic computing is a technique that allows one program to manipulate another program into performing complex computations without exploiting vulnerabilities. It was first proposed in 2001 by researchers at the University of Notre Dame. The technique involves sending smaller computational problems to another computer over the internet, under the guise of a standard communication session. As the receiving computer checks the validity of the packets, it unknowingly performs computations for the sending computer. Despite being inefficient in practice, this proof-of-concept demonstrates the concept of parasitic computing. The concept has potential applications in breaking down complex problems into queries of cryptographic protocols, potentially creating a distributed computing network without the hosts' awareness. In 2002, students from the University of Applied Sciences in Switzerland extended this concept into a programmable virtual machine.",

Unlike shared everything systems, SN does not allow multiple nodes to access the same memory or storage independently. This eliminates single points of failure, enabling the system to function even if individual nodes fail. Scaling is achieved by adding nodes, as there are no central resources bottlenecks. Data is typically partitioned among nodes, with commonly used data replicated for quicker access.",

They are crucial for tasks in quantum mechanics, weather forecasting, molecular modeling, and more. Developed in the 1960s by Seymour Cray, supercomputers have evolved from highly tuned designs to massively parallel systems with tens of thousands of processors. The US has historically been a leader in the field, but Japan and China have made significant advancements. As of May 2022, the fastest supercomputer is Frontier in the US, followed by Fugaku. All top 10 supercomputers on the TOP500 list have now broken the 1 exaFLOPS mark. Additional research is ongoing worldwide to develop even faster exascale supercomputers.",

However, the demand for greater computational power led to the rise of massively parallel systems in the 1990s, with machines containing thousands of processors becoming common by the end of the 20th century. Today, supercomputers can use over 100,000 processors connected by fast connections.\n\nHeat management has always been a challenge for centralized supercomputers, with diverse approaches including liquid cooling and air conditioning. Systems with a large number of processors typically fall into one of two categories: grid computing, where processing power from distributed computers is used opportunistically, and computer clusters, where processors work closely together. The speed and flexibility of the interconnect is crucial in centralized massively parallel systems, with modern supercomputers utilizing various approaches such ",

This allows for efficient resource use and cost minimization. The shift to on-demand computing, software as a service, and cloud computing models has been built on this concept. Initially met with skepticism, utility computing has now become mainstream, with companies like IBM, HP, and Microsoft leading the way, followed by Google, Amazon, and others.\n\nUtility computing can support grid computing, using a large number of computers to handle very large computations or sudden peaks in demand. It usually involves virtualization and multiple servers, sometimes using distributed computing to run calculations on multiple computers. Grid computing can be geographically distributed or cross administrative domains. Companies can bundle public resources for sale, with participants possibly receiving a portion of the revenue. Different models, such as central server task dispersion or decentralized buying and selling of computing resources, can be used.\n\nThe term \"utility computing\" is sometimes extended to specialized tasks, like web services.",

This helps reduce costs and standardize data definitions for integrating business systems. The model is based on agreed-upon standards and simplifies communication by providing a common view within a given context. Adopting a canonical model often involves using an enterprise service bus or EAI solution to transport messages between endpoints. This allows for consistent message payload structure and content, improving consistency, reusability, and data integrity. The model also helps reduce data translations and maintenance efforts, making it an effective integration strategy.",

This limits data sharing and poses challenges for data mining. Silos occur when data systems are incompatible or not integrated. The root cause is often data modeling methods, leading to issues in technical, application, or data architecture. Businesses struggle to use data effectively due to these silos.",

        "term": "Integrated software",
        "content": "Integrated software combines multiple commonly used functions from various productivity software programs into a single application for personal computers. In the early days of computing, when user interfaces were text-based, integrated software provided a more convenient and consistent experience for users. It eliminated the need to switch between programs and made exchanging data easier.\n\nAlthough the rise of fully functional office suites like Microsoft Office overshadowed integrated software, it was once considered a key factor in the success of the IBM PC. Examples of integrated software include AppleWorks for the Apple II, Vizastar for the Commodore 64, and Context MBA, which featured spreadsheet, database, word processing, and other functions.\n\nAs graphical user interfaces became more prevalent, the need for integrated software diminished. Developers questioned its viability and argued that using multiple standalone applications with common interfaces was preferable. However, integrated software continued to have a market, particularly for notebook users, home and small-business users. Microsoft Works and ClarisWorks were examples of integrated software suites developed for these users.\n\nDuring the 1990s, office suites like Microsoft Office and LibreOffice gained popularity, offering more complex software with greater abilities. While these suites resemble integrated software in some ways, they are more advanced and often sold as standalone products. Integrated software may have been overshadowed by office suites, but it still serves a purpose for specific user groups.",

It involves associating meaning with individual data elements in one system to create equivalent meaning in another. An example is converting XML data using formal ontologies like OWL. Semantic translation is used by intelligent agents accessing systems with different data models. It is not the same as simple data mapping, as it requires semantic mappings and can be challenging if there are no direct mappings between terms. Centralized metadata registries, like NIEM, can help alleviate this issue.",

It allows for accelerated delivery of business applications and enables a wider range of contributors, not just those with coding skills. LCDPs trace their roots back to fourth-generation programming language and rapid application development tools. They are based on model-driven architecture and automatic code generation. The concept of end-user development existed previously, but LCDPs brought new approaches. The low-code development platform market traces back to 2011, and the specific name \"low-code\" was coined in 2014 by industry analyst Forrester Research. Along with no-code development platforms, low-code was described as \"extraordinarily disruptive\" in Forbes mag",

This concept applies to various systems, interfaces, signals, protocols, formats, and languages. A standard is forward compatible if a product complying with earlier versions can handle input from later versions without issue. The goal is for older devices to recognize data generated for new devices. Typically, forward compatibility for older systems means backward compatibility for new systems - the new system can process data from the old system and may also generate data in the old system's format.\n\nHowever, forward compatibility differs from extensibility.

It goes beyond just data packaging (syntax) by also transmitting the meaning (semantics) with the data through metadata and shared vocabulary.\n\nSyntactic interoperability, which deals with data packaging and transmission mechanisms, is a prerequisite for semantic interoperability. In healthcare, HL7 and XML are commonly used standards for data interchange. However, the lack of practical data dictionaries and information models has hindered meaningful data exchange, leading to data \"babelization.\"\n\nThe introduction of the Semantic Web concept by Tim Berners-Lee in 1999 has sparked interest in using W3C standards for web-scale semantic data exchange, federation, and inferencing. These standards provide the foundation for machine interpretation, inference, and logic in exchanging data with shared meaning.",

        "content": "\"Write once, run anywhere\" (WORA) was a slogan coined by Sun Microsystems in 1995 to highlight Java's cross-platform capabilities. It allowed developers to create code on any device, compile it into bytecode, and run it on any device with a Java virtual machine (JVM). This eliminated the need for multiple versions of software for different platforms. However, the presence of multiple JVM implementations and operating systems could lead to slight differences in execution, requiring testing on each platform, giving rise to the saying \"Write Once, Debug Everywhere.\" MicroEJ, like Squeak Smalltalk, guarantees true WORA semantic by providing a virtual execution environment with one consistent Java thread policy across all implementations.",

It evolved from Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks and is expected to lead to an \"Internet of autonomous vehicles\". IoV will enable an autonomous, connected, electric, and shared (ACES) Future Mobility. IoV depends on modern infrastructure and architectures to distribute computational burden across multiple processing units. In the consumer market, IoV is often associated with smart cities and driverless cars. Concerns about privacy and security have led to the development of international standards and methods of real-time analysis, with organizations like the Linux Foundation's ELISA, the IEEE, and the CTIA addressing these concerns. Open-source software and systems are important for IoV functionality, with examples like Subaru's infotainment platform that can detect a driver's wakefulness and sound an alarm for a rest.",
