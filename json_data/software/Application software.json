It provides over 280 services like making appointments, renewing passports, and driver's licenses. However, controversially, it allows men to track women they control under the country's male guardianship system. The app, available on Google Play and the App Store, is managed by the Saudi Interior Ministry and has over 20 million users. In 2021, a digital ID version was launched with new services like online birth registration and correcting academic credentials and names.",

Only 12% of Italians aged 14-75 had downloaded the app, far below the 60% needed for effectiveness. Developed by Bending Spoons and released by the Italian Ministry of Health on 1 June 2020, the app utilized the Apple/Google Exposure Notification system and was active nationwide from 15 June 2020. The source code was published on GitHub on 25 May, and the app supported key-exchanges with other EU countries. By December 2020, it had been downloaded over 10 million times, reaching 21.882.502 downloads by the shutdown. The app and its infrastructures were officially dismissed on 31 December 2022.",

They worked on major projects like the Golden Gate Bridge, California Memorial Stadium, and the Space Needle. During WWII, they built landing crafts and steel barges for the war effort. The company also expanded into tuna fishing ships after the war. Soule Steel was family-owned and grew to have multiple fabrication shops, a steel mill, and divisions for steel buildings and windows. They closed in 1986, with their former plants now housing business centers, apartments, and warehouses. The Soulé family was known for their philanthropy, supporting various charities over the years.",

Originally developed by Doug and Nancy Woodward, it was acquired by Novell in 1987. In 1994, the Woodwards and Ron Harris formed Btrieve Technologies, Inc. to develop the product independently. Btrieve became modularized in version 6.15, integrating with the MicroKernel Database Engine and Scalable SQL. Pervasive Software was formed and later merged Btrieve and Scalable SQL into Pervasive.SQL, later known as Actian Zen. Customers were encouraged to upgrade to Pervasive.SQL, which supported both SQL and Btrieve applications.",

Developed in the late 1970s at Brigham Young University, it quickly became popular in the 1980s and 1990s, surpassing WordStar as the market leader. Offering advanced features and clean display, it became the standard in the DOS market by the late 1980s.\n\nHowever, WordPerfect's dominance declined after a failed release for Microsoft Windows. The delay in reprogramming to improve its performance, combined with Microsoft Word's faster speed and aggressive marketing tactics, led to WordPerfect losing its position as a popular standard by the mid-1990s. The company went through ownership changes, with Corel (now Alludo) acquiring WordPerfect in 1996 and continuing to release updates and office suites under the WordPerfect name.\n\nWordPerfect document files typically use the .wpd extension, with older versions using variations like .wp, .wp7, .wp6, and .wp5. Despite its past success, WordPerfect is no longer the dominant word processing application it once was.",

The current version is 14.10, used in high transaction rate applications in various sectors. Extensions allow Informix to support data types not in the SQL standard. Recently, HCL released OneDB Database Server V1.0.0.0 based on Informix, followed by OneDB 2.0 as a cloud-native, multi-cloud offering in 2021. Actian, now part of HCL, will likely take over the Informix portfolio, with HCL Informix and OneDB already available for download from Actian's portal.",

It can edit raster images in layers, with masks and alpha compositing. Photoshop supports its own file formats, PSD and PSB, and also has limited abilities for text, vector graphics, 3D graphics, and video editing. Plug-ins can be used to expand its features. \n\nPhotoshop's naming scheme changed in 2002 to \"CS\" followed by a number, with versions like Photoshop CS and CS2. In 2013, it switched to the Creative Cloud branding with the \"CC\" suffix, moving to a software as a service subscription model. Photoshop was historically bundled with software like Adobe ImageReady, Fireworks, Bridge, Device Central, and Camera RAW.\n\nAside from Photoshop, Adobe offers Photoshop Elements, Lightroom, Express, Fix, Illustrator, and Mix. A full version of Photoshop for iPad was released in November 2019, with plans for more features in the future. All Adobe products under the Photoshop umbrella are known as \"The Adobe Photoshop Family\".",

Since 2010, Crowdmap has been used to document global events like the Occupy movement and London protests. The platform has evolved to include Checkins, a geosocial feature for quicker data entry. Users can focus on location first and add details later, creating a white-label alternative to Foursquare and Gowalla. Ushahidi calls this effort \"checkins with a purpose\".",

The app turns any iOS or Android smartphone into a mouse, with the printed surface as the screen. The digital twin mimics the printed page, allowing for web links and features, providing the same functionality as a touch screen device. Developed and funded in Australia, Netpage was first launched in Esquire magazine's December 2012 edition.",

The FMS interface broadcasts data such as vehicle speed, clutch and brake status, fuel levels, engine hours, and more. This data is coded according to SAE J1939 and allows for manufacturer-independent applications and evaluations.\n\nThe FMS standard is considered a worldwide standard by truck manufacturers, but direct connections to the vehicle's internal bus system are not permitted and could void the warranty. As of 2007, around 160,000 vehicles were equipped with an FMS interface, with over 400,000 trucks in North America using FMS by 2019.\n\nIn 2004, the FMS-Standard also served as the foundation for the Bus-FMS-Standard for buses and coaches, expanding the capabilities of this technology for use in the public transportation sector.",

It uses real-time inventory from providers like airlines and hotels to link services, rates, and bookings for travel agencies. Unlike a computer reservation system, GDS is used by travel agents to access vendors' inventory directly. GDS does not hold inventory but has a real-time link to the vendor's system for making reservations. For example, when a travel agency requests a booking with an airline, the GDS system routes the request to the airline's reservation system.",

MVNEs help MVNOs reduce upfront costs, access financing, and benefit from economies of scale. However, not all MVNOs may benefit from using an MVNE, especially if they are large enough to negotiate directly with the host operator, have strong branding and distribution channels, or have access to existing telecom infrastructure.",

Some top PRM providers include Salesforce, Zift Solutions, and Magentrix. The purpose of PRM is to improve partner management by introducing reliable systems, automated processes, and optimization tools. Web-based PRM systems typically include a Content Management System, a partner and customer contact database, and a partner portal. Vendors use PRM solutions to reduce costs, automate processes, establish new partnerships, and drive revenue through channel sales. Unlike CRM systems, which focus on end customers, PRM systems are tailored to help partners sell on behalf of the vendor, offering self-service tools, information, and resources.",

These websites allow users to interact through social media, create content, and participate in virtual communities. Examples of Web 2.0 features include social networking sites, blogs, wikis, video and image sharing sites, and web applications. Some, like Tim Berners-Lee, argue that Web 2.0 is just jargon and not fundamentally different from previous web technologies. Others, like Berners-Lee himself, advocate for the Semantic Web, a vision where web content can be processed by machines for greater efficiency.",

It allows developers to create hybrid apps for mobile devices using CSS3, HTML5, and JavaScript, eliminating the need for platform-specific APIs. Cordova wraps CSS, HTML, and JavaScript code based on the device platform, extending their features to work with the device. The resulting applications are hybrid, not truly native or purely web-based, as they use web views for layout rendering and have access to native device APIs. Cordova has been used by tools and frameworks like Ionic, Monaca, and VoltBuilder. Contributors to the project include Adobe, BlackBerry, Google, IBM, and others.",

The Windows version faced challenges including delays, copy protection issues, and the rise of the World Wide Web. Telix is used for dialing bulletin board systems and supports ANSI emulation and file transfer protocols.",

Originally developed in the 1980s for the EPA, the model has since been refined and updated as DSSAM II and DSSAM III, based on the Total Maximum Daily Load metric. The model has been instrumental in the EPA's national policy for managing river systems in the US. The Truckee River, with over 115 miles in length and draining an area of 3120 square miles, has multiple monitoring points along its length and in Pyramid Lake. Despite low population density, water quality in the region is critical due to its popularity with visitors and impact on endangered species like the Cui-ui sucker f",

Developed in the 1960s and 1970s due to environmental legislation and advances in computer power, these models come in various types based on pollutants addressed, complexity, and time period modeled. Models can be steady state or dynamic, distributed or lumped, and include the ability to predict multiple points within a river. Physically based models can measure parameters in the field and may include modules for surface runoff calculation based on land use, topography, soil type, vegetation, precipitation, and land management practices. The focus of this article is typically on river watersheds.",

It calculates ET as a residual of the surface energy balance, considering factors such as radiation, heat conducted into soil, and heat convected into the air above the surface. The model is internally calibrated using ground-based reference ET and is designed for routine application by trained professionals. METRIC has been adopted in several states, enabling them to negotiate water rights, manage aquifer depletion, and monitor water usage for various purposes. The model's ability to detect reduced ET due to water shortage has proven valuable in various applications.",
