CCS applies critical hermeneutics to interpret code, program architecture, and documentation within a socio-historical context. It holds that lines of code are not value-neutral and can be analyzed using theoretical approaches applied to other semiotic systems. Originally a method to read and explicate code like a work of literature, CCS also draws upon the concept of a cybertext as a \"mechanical device for the production and consumption of verbal signs.\" Evidence of CCS's momentum since 2006 includes an article in The Chronicle of Higher Education, packed sessions at the Modern Language Association, academic conferences devoted to critical code studies, and a book dedicated t",

The first machines were based on Intel microprocessors and designed for automation and machine code learning. In 1978, the Silex microcomputer was released, using a licensed Apple II motherboard with a MOS 6502 and 32Kb RAM. It was expensive, priced at 29,000 Francs and included basic and Pascal interpreters and a disk operating system. The Sil'z was released in 1979, CP/M compatible, powered by a Zilog Z80 at 2.5 MHz, with two 5'' 1/4 320Kb disc drives. Later models, such as the Sil'z II, Sil'z III, and Sil'z IV, were released in the following years, with the Sil'z IV featuring a separate keyboard and monitor and adding a hard drive. The Sil'z 16, released in 1983, featured the Nanoréseau, a small network based on the RS422 standard, and later machines were PC compatible. Later models, such as the Challenger Elan series, were 16-bit ISA backplane machines. In 1989, Léanord merged with Intertechnique and was eventuall",

These computers were popular in France due to the government's educational program Informatique pour Tous, with around 100,000 installed in schools. However, export attempts were unsuccessful and by 1988 Thomson had only sold 60,000 of the predicted 150,000 computers, leading to the abandonment of computer development in the following year.

        "content": "In April 2010, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology in India commissioned the Human-Centred Design & Computing Group at C-DAC, Pune to prepare a National Study Report on Digital Preservation Requirements in India. The objective was to assess the current state of digital preservation in India and make recommendations for the National Digital Preservation Program, involving stakeholders from various sectors.\n\nExperts from 24 organizations participated in the national expert group, representing domains such as e-governance, archives, cultural heritage, health, science, education, insurance, banking, and law. They submitted position papers outlining short-term and long-term digital preservation plans for their respective domains. The study report, presented in two volumes, included recommendations for the National Digital Preservation Program and position papers by the expert group members.\n\nThe report covered international digital preservation projects, legal imperatives, technical challenges, and standards. One key recommendation was to align various Acts with the Information Technology Act to address digital preservation needs. This recommendation was validated in 2018 when the Indian judiciary began drafting electronic evidence rules under the Indian Evidence Act. A Joint Committee of High Court Judges visited C-DAC, Pune in March 2018 to examine technical aspects of the proposed rules.",

The name refers to a Dutch expression meaning \"to make a clean sweep\". Veltman initially created the program to compute the quadrupole moment of the W boson, which involved a complex calculation. The initial version ran on an IBM 7094 mainframe, and was later ported to other mainframes and microprocessor systems. Schoonschip had an impact on the development of FORM, and contacts with Veltman were important for Stephen Wo",

It followed earlier series like The Computer Programme and focused on live broadcasts. The series began with a two-hour special in 1983 and continued as a regular one-hour series starting in October 1984. It later transitioned to a weekly half-hour format, airing its final episode in 1987.\n\nMicro Live had a broader scope than previous computer series and featured a variety of microcomputers, not just the BBC Micro. The show also included stories from the United States and highlighted significant milestones, such as the first on-air transatlantic mobile phone call. The series had a less formal feel due to its live nature, making it unique among computer programs at the time.",

Originally aimed at promoting basic computer science education, it became popular for diverse uses due to its low cost, modularity, and open design. The Foundation established Raspberry Pi (Trading) Ltd. to develop their computers and became an educational charity. Most are made in Wales, with some also made in China and Japan. In 2015, Raspberry Pi became the best-selling British computer, surpassing the ZX Spectrum. In 2021, Raspberry Pi (Trading) Ltd changed its name to Raspberry Pi Ltd. In June 2024, it became a public company, trading under the name RPI on the London Stock Exchange.",

However, it is vulnerable to a chosen-plaintext attack requiring 259 queries and negligible work. The algorithm was designed by Roger Needham and David Wheeler of the Cambridge Computer Laboratory in 1998 and is not patented. XXTEA operates on variable-length blocks, using a round function that makes use of immediate neighbors in processing each word. It is likely more efficient than XTEA for longer messages.",

It was formulated in 2013 and is similar to proof of work (PoW), but uses storage to earn cryptocurrency. PoS is seen as a fairer and greener alternative to PoW due to its lower energy cost. In 2014, Signum (formerly Burstcoin) became the first practical implementation of PoS and is still actively developed. Other implementations like SpaceMint and Chia have been released, but some have faced criticism for increasing demand and shortening the life of storage devices.",

The advent of computers and simulations in the 1950s reduced computation time, allowing for more accurate forecasts. Global forecasting models and limited area models for regional forecasts were developed, leading to the first climate models and improved tracking of tropical cyclones and air quality. Model output statistics (MOS) were developed in the 1970s and 1980s to correct forecast model output based on atmospheric dynamics. Despite advancements in supercomputing power, the forecast skill of numerical weather models only extends to about two weeks into the future due to observational limitations and the chaotic nature of the equations used. Ensemble forecasts have been utilized since the 1990s to define forecast uncertainty and extend weather forecasting beyond the two-week limit.",

From scientific computations in the 18th century to designing the first algorithm for a computer by Ada Lovelace, women played a significant role. Grace Hopper designed the first compiler for a programming language, and women dominated programming work up to World War II. However, after the 1960s, the importance of women in computing decreased as modern software evolved.\n\nThe gender disparity in computing has been examined, but firm explanations are lacking. Nevertheless, women continued to make significant contributions, and efforts were made to address the gender imbalance. In the 21st century, women have held leadership roles in multiple tech companies, including Meg Cushing Whitman at Hewlett Packard Enter",

Discrete transistors became more reliable and affordable than vacuum tubes from 1953 to 1959, leading to the development of semiconductor memory in the mid-to-late 1960s and the microprocessor in the early 1970s. This transition replaced magnetic-core memory with semiconductor memory, reducing the cost, size, and power consumption of computers. ",

The company originated from the amalgamation of enterprises dedicated to automating routine business transactions, notably pioneering punched card-based data tabulating machines and time clocks. In 1911, these entities were unified under the umbrella of the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (CTR).\n\nThomas J. Watson became the general manager in 1914 and later the President in 1915. By 1924, the company rebranded as \"International Business Machines\" and diversified its offerings to include electric typewriters and office equipment. IBM began its forays into computing in the 1940s and 1950s, and in the 1960s introduced the System/360 family of mainframe computers.\n\nIBM encountered difficulties in the late 1980s and 1990s, marked by substantial losses. The company struggled to adapt to the growing Unix open systems and personal computer revolutions. IBM responded with a Unix line and a range of personal computers, but faced competition from clone manufacturers offering cost-effective alternatives.\n\nThrough strategic reorganizations, IBM sustained its status as one of the world's largest computer companies and systems integrators. As of 2014, the company had over 400,000 employees globally and held the highest number of patents among U.S.-based technology firms. IBM employees were recognized with numerous accolades, including Nobel Prizes, Turing Awards, National Medals of Technology, and National Medals of Science.",

The goal was to have Spain and the Catholic League in France invade England and restore the old religion. The plot was discovered by Elizabeth's spymaster Sir Francis Walsingham and used to remove Mary as a claimant to the English throne. Chief conspirators were Anthony Babington and John Ballard. The plot was revealed through the work of double agents and spies, culminating in Mary's letter ordering the assassination of Elizabeth.

The U.S. Navy, led by Admirals Nimitz, Fletcher, and Spruance, decisively defeated the Imperial Japanese Navy, inflicting heavy damage. The Japanese, looking to extend their defensive perimeter, hoped to trap American aircraft carriers, but faulty planning and U.S. codebreaking undermined their strategy. The battle resulted in the sinking of four Japanese carriers and one cruiser, and the loss of one American carrier and a destroyer. Following Midway and the Solomon Islands campaign, Japan's ability to replace losses was insufficient, while the U.S. had the industrial and training capacity to do so. Many consider Midway a turning point in the Pacific War.",

The first unsolved text describes the location, the second ciphertext details the contents of the treasure, and the third unsolved text lists the names of the treasure's owners and their next of kin.\n\nThe story originates from an 1885 pamphlet called The Beale Papers, detailing treasure buried by a man named Thomas J. Beale in Virginia in about 1820. Beale entrusted the encrypted messages to an innkeeper named Robert Morriss before disappearing. The innkeeper eventually gave the messages to a friend, who spent years trying to decode them and only managed to solve one.\n\nSeveral attempts have been made to decode the remaining messages and locate the treasure, but all have failed. There are arguments that the entire story is a hoax, including historical records that cast doubt on the existence of Thomas J. Beale. An analysis suggests that the documents could not have been written at the alleged time, and the writing style indicates that Beale was likely James B. Ward, who brought the Beale Pap",

By 1932, the Bureau had successfully decrypted Germany's Enigma ciphers and also broke Soviet codes. In 1939, they shared their decryption techniques with French and British intelligence, providing the Allies with a significant advantage in World War II. This transfer of intelligence and technology, known as Ultra, proved instrumental in the Allies' victory.",

However, no lossless compression algorithm can shrink the size of all possible data, as some data will get longer by at least one symbol or byte.\n\nCompression algorithms are effective for human- and machine-readable documents, but cannot shrink the size of random data without redundancy. Lossless data compression is used in various applications, such as the ZIP file format and the GNU tool gzip. It is also utilized within lossy data compression technologies.\n\nLossless compression is important in cases where the original and decompressed data must be identical, such as in executable programs, text documents, and source code. Additionally, some image and audio file formats use only lossless compression for archiving or production purposes, while smaller lossy audio fi",

Launched in 1990 by Hugh Loebner, it was later organized by the AISB at Bletchley Park, and associated with various institutions. The competition has been controversial within the field of artificial intelligence, with prominent critic Marvin Minsky calling it a publicity stunt. The format changed for the 2019 competition, with the chatbots judged by the public and no human competitors. The prize has been reported as defunct as of 2020.",

This is theoretically possible and unique for polynomials with coefficients in any field, but practical algorithms are limited to finite fields, rational numbers, or their extensions. Factorization algorithms for multivariate polynomials ultimately reduce to the univariate case. This process has applications in coding theory, cryptography, and computational number theory.

It simplifies the deduction of properties of the ideal and associated algebraic variety, making it a practical tool for solving systems of polynomial equations and computing images of algebraic varieties. Gröbner basis computation is a generalization of Euclid's algorithm and Gaussian elimination. Introduced by Bruno Buchberger in 1965, they were named after his advisor Wolfgang Gröbner. The theory has been extended to other structures, including polynomials over principal ideal rings and non-commutative rings.",

When dealing with univariate polynomials over a field, the polynomial GCD can be computed using the Euclidean algorithm with long division. The polynomial GCD is defined up to multiplication by an invertible constant. This concept shares similarities with the integer GCD, and properties deduced from the Euclidean algorithm can be extended to univariate polynomials. The roots of the polynomial GCD give information about the common roots of the original polynomials and can be used to compute square-free factorization. The GCD also applies to multivariate polynomials over a field or the ring of integers, and algorithms exist to compute it. These algorithms are used in computer algebra systems to simplify fractions, and modern theory of polynomial GCD has been developed to satisfy the need for efficiency in these systems.",

It simplifies complex division problems into smaller ones and is similar to arithmetic long division. An abbreviated method called synthetic division or polynomial short division (Blomqvist's method) can be faster with less writing and fewer calculations.\n\nThe algorithm implements the Euclidean division of polynomials, producing a quotient Q and a remainder R such that A = BQ + R, with R = 0 or a degree lower than B. R = 0 occurs if A has B as a factor, making long division a method for testing f",

The resultant is used in number theory and can be efficiently computed on a computer. It is a fundamental tool in computer algebra and is used for various purposes, such as cylindrical algebraic decomposition and integration of rational functions. The resultant of n homogeneous polynomials in n variables, also known as the multivariate resultant, is a generalization introduced by Macaulay and is a key tool in elimination theory, along with Gröbner bases.",

It can also locate these roots by counting changes in the sequence's values at the interval's bounds. While the fundamental theorem of algebra provides the overall number of complex roots, Sturm's theorem isolates and counts distinct real roots, creating the oldest real-root isolation algorithm. Although less efficient than other methods for computing over the reals, it is fundamental for the theoretical study of computational complexity in the first-order theory of real numbers. The theorem was discovered by Jacques Charles François Sturm in 1829.",

Methods for solving the SR problem include genetic programming, Bayesian methods, neural networks, and the Universal Functions Originator (UFO) method.\n\nSR does not rely on a predefined model, avoiding human bias and unknown gaps in knowledge. It aims to uncover dataset relationships without imposing a model structure. The fitness function considers error metrics and complexity measures to reveal underlying structure without overfitting.\n\nSR can prioritize accuracy and simplicity separately, leading to a Pareto front of optimum solutions, or combine them using principles like minimum description length. It is a NP-hard problem, meaning it may not always find the best expression in polynomial time, but exact solutions are possible for less complex equations.",

Wu's method is particularly useful for mechanical theorem proving in elementary geometry and provides a complete decision process for certain problems. It has been used in research around the world, with a focus on systems of polynomial equations of positive dimension and differentia",

        "content": "The Green Power Usage Effectiveness (GPUE) is a proposed measurement of sustainable energy usage and carbon footprint per usable kilowatt hour (kWh) in computer data centers. It measures how effectively a data center uses its power, specifically how much power is used by computing equipment. It is an addition to the Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) definition and was first proposed by Greenqloud. The Green Grid has developed the PUE metric to measure a data center's effectiveness in getting power to IT equipment. PUE tells how much extra energy is needed for each usable kWh for IT equipment due to power going into cooling and power loss. The PUE can change depending on measurements' location, timing, and timespan, and some issues with PUE are being addressed with the PUEx definition. GPUE \"weighs\" the PUE to better see which data centers are the greenest in terms of emitting the least amount of CO2 due to sustainable or unsustainable energy sources. GPUE is calculated using a weighted sum of energy sources and their lifecycle KG CO2/KWh. For example, with a PUE of 1.20 and a 50/50 coal/hydro energy source, the GPUE would be 1.84 or 0.64 kg CO2 per usable kWh.",

It was originally created at the Technical Support Unit of the Department of Trade and Industry in the United Kingdom. The benchmark was designed to be practical and was later improved to measure performance in millions of Whetstone Instructions Per Second (MWIPS) to account for increased computer speeds. Source code and pre-compiled versions for PCs in various programming languages are available. The benchmark primarily measures floating-point arithmetic performance, while the Dhrystone benchmark is used for integer and string operations.",

It enables the host system to run software or use peripheral devices designed for the guest system. Emulation can be seen in printers that emulate HP LaserJet printers to run software written for HP printers. Video game enthusiasts use emulators to play classic arcade games from the 1980s and old video game consoles. A hardware emulator takes the form of a hardware device, like the DOS-compatible card in some 1990s-era Macintosh computers. The Church-Turing thesis states that theoretically, any operating environment can be emulated in another environment, but in practice, it can be difficult, particularly when the behavior of the system to be emulated is not documented. Timing constraints can also affect the performance of software inside the emulation.",

A hardware security module (HSM) is a physical device that manages digital keys for authentication and cryptoprocessing. Providers differentiate hardware security from software security by using non-Turing-machine logic, often implemented with FPGAs. Hardware backdoors and hardware Trojans are malicious modifications to electronic systems. Physical unclonable functions (PUFs) are hard-to-predict, easy-to-evaluate physical entities used in high-security applications. Organizations must also address internal threats to sensitive data and resources.",

This approach, part of information-centric networking (ICN), involves the exchange of content requests (Interests) and return messages (Content Objects). In this paradigm, intermittent connectivity is accounted for and storage can be leveraged transparently. Mobility and multi-access are normal, and anycast, multicast, and broadcast are natively supported. Data becomes independent from location, application, and means of transportation, enabling in-network caching and replication. The expected benefits include improved efficiency, better scalability",

It is essential for business continuity and typically includes redundant or backup components for power supply, data communication connections, and security devices. With estimated global electricity consumption of 240-340 TWh in 2022, data centers can vary widely in terms of size, power requirements, and overall structure. Four common categories used to segment types of data centers are onsite data centers, colocation facilities, hyperscale data centers, a",

It uses a cell relay protocol similar to Asynchronous Transfer Mode and is still in use by major U.S. telephone companies. Datakit supports various interfaces and operates over multiple media, including fiber optic links and Ethernet. The Information Systems Network (ISN) was the pre-version of Datakit. By the late 1990s, new technologies, such as IP and Ethernet, superseded Datakit, leading to its eventual discontinuation by Lucent Technologies. Datatek Applications, a firm founded by former Lucent employees, aimed to support remaining Datakit users, but eventually went out of business in January 2018.",

This technique takes advantage of the fact that not all users are connected to the network at the same time, and not all users are transmitting data constantly. Most traffic occurs in bursts, creating gaps between packets that can be filled with other user traffic. Different network protocols impl",

Chuck Welch, also known as Cracker Jack Kid, played a key role in connecting early online artists. By the late 1990s, mailartists began migrating collective art projects towards the web, utilizing Mail Art blogs and websites to display contributions. Online documentation and submissions of Email art became increasingly common, with some projects exclusively focused on digital communication. In 2006, artist Ramzi Turki received and circulated a scanned work by Belgian artist Luc Fierens, resulting in 200",

        "content": "Etherloop is a hybrid technology that combines aspects of Ethernet with other technologies to achieve results not possible with either technology alone. It was originally developed in the 1990s to provide high-speed data communication access to residential customers over standard telephone lines. This allowed telephone companies to compete with cable TV providers. Etherloop combines Ethernet protocol concepts with Digital subscriber line (DSL) technology to facilitate voice and data transmission on legacy phone lines over several kilometers. By using digital signal processors (DSP), Etherloop can achieve high-quality, high-speed data transmission. The technology has broader applications beyond its original purpose, including use in automotive intra-vehicle communication in the 2020s. This involves a gigabit Ethernet physical network with a proprietary time-sliced networ",

It refers to a high-performance computing system consisting of storage, networking, and parallel processing functions linked by high bandwidth interconnects. The fundamental components are \"nodes\" (processors, memory, and peripherals) and \"links\" (functional connections between nodes). The term has also been used in association with storage area networks and switched fabric networking. Ian Foster suggested in 2007 that grid computing \"fabrics\" were \"poised to become the underpinning for next-generation enterprise IT architectures and be used by a much greater part of many or",

Failover can be automated, using a \"heartbeat\" system to detect failures and switch to the backup, or require human intervention. Failback, on the other hand, is the process of restoring the original system after a failure, while virtualization technology has made failover less reliant on physical hardware. Microsoft SQL Server also uses failover technology to ensure high availability and reliability, allowing the database to switch to a backup node in case of issues and then failback once the issues are resolved.",

        "content": "Label switching is a technique used in network relaying to address issues with traditional IP-table switching. It operates at the data link layer instead of the network layer, allowing for faster packet switching. Technologies such as MPLS and ATM utilize label switching. According to RFC 2475, examples of label switching models include Frame Relay, ATM, and MPLS, which allow for finer granularity in resource allocation and traffic management. Multilayer switching involves examining layer 3, layer 4, and layer 7 information in routing devices.",

        "term": "Lanstar",
        "content": "LANStar was a 2.56 Mbit/s twisted-pair local area network introduced by Northern Telecom in the '80s. It used existing PBX wiring for data transmission. Initially part of the PTE product, which included office automation apps, it was phased out when PCs and PC networking gained popularity. NT repackaged it as the PTE-S, a smaller version supporting up to 112 nodes. It was compatible with PC/XT, PC/AT, and MacII and supported NetBIOS, Banyan, Novell, and AppleTalk. LANStar was discontinued in 1990. Its name was derived from AT&T's StarLAN to piggyback on its publicity.",
