It relates the system's outputs to its inputs, making it useful for linear time-invariant (LTI) systems expressed in terms of the s-plane. In electrical engineering, voltage variables are grouped on one side and current variables on the other, resulting in all elements of the transfer matrix being in units of impedance. Impedance (and impedance matrices) has been borrowed into other energy domains by analogy, such as mechanics and acoustics. Control systems often span multiple energy domains, requiring transfer",

It can be achieved using mechanical systems or other methods like passive cooling and ventilative cooling. Heat pumps, which can both heat and cool spaces, are similar to air conditioners.\n\nAir conditioners range from small units for vehicles or single rooms to massive units for large buildings. Air source heat pumps are also becoming more common for both heating and cooling in cooler climates.\n\nAs of 2018, 1.6 billion air conditioning units were installed globally, accounting for an estimated 20% of electricity usage in buildings, with projections to grow to 5.6 billion by 2050. The United Nations has called for more sustainable technologies and alternatives like passive cooling, evaporative cooling, and better insulation to mitigate climate change. Refrigerants used in air conditioners, such as CFCs, HCFCs, and HFCs, have contributed to ozone layer depletion and climate change.",

        "content": "An Energy Management System (EMS) is a computer system designed to automate control and monitoring of energy consumption in buildings, including heating, ventilation, and lighting. It can be used in single buildings or groups of buildings, offering features such as meter reading, self-diagnostic and optimization routines, and trend analysis. EMS are also used by commercial entities to monitor and control their electrical building loads, including HVAC and lighting systems across multiple locations. Smart Energy Management Systems (SEMS) can dynamically adapt and efficiently manage new energy scenarios with minimal human intervention through the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning models. SEMS are used in residential, commercial, and industrial applications and play a key role in smart grid concepts. As electric vehicle (EV) charging becomes more popular, smaller residential devices that manage when an EV can charge based on the total load vs total capacity of an electrical service are becoming popular. The global energy management system market is projected to grow exponentially over the next 10-15 years, and the integration of EMS in smart grids, battery storage systems, electric mobility, and renewable energy sources is an important area of application of the Internet of Things in the context of smart homes and smart buildings.",

It includes design, financing, installation, and maintenance. LaaS allows customers to outsource their lighting needs over a specific time period. Unlike an operating lease, the LaaS provider retains ownership of the equipment, promoting environmental sustainability and extended product life. This model is increasingly common in commercial LED light installations, aiming to reduce installation costs. LaaS is important for companies due to considerations such as safety, environmental performance, energy consumption, and product durability. It allows for economic operation of buildings with energy-efficient lighting",

It supports communication through serial lines, Ethernet, or the Internet protocol suite, allowing multiple devices to connect to the same cable or network. It is commonly used in supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems to connect a plant/system supervisory computer with a remote terminal unit (RTU). The Modbus Organization, established in 2004, manages the development and update of Modbus protocols and advocates for its continued use.",

        "content": "Commissioning is an integrated, systematic process in construction to ensure that all building systems perform according to the \"Design Intent\". It involves establishing and documenting the criteria for system function, performance expectations, and maintainability, and verifying compliance throughout all project phases. While historically focused on HVAC systems, the scope of commissioning has expanded to include other building systems. The U.S. General Services Administration published a guide in 2005 that outlines the process for including building commissioning in all project phases. As building systems become more integrated, the need for comprehensive commissioning has increased. 'Whole Building Commissioning' is now the standard, with partial commissioning still utilized for specific equipment or systems. The Owner's Project Requirements and the Architect/Engineer's design should clearly define the scope and expectations of commissioning.",

It is designed for small scale projects requiring wireless connection, such as home automation and medical device data collection. It is intended to be simpler and less expensive than other wireless personal area networks (WPANs) like Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. Zigbee devices have a transmission range of 10-100 meters and can transmit data over long distances through a mesh network. The technology is best suited for intermittent data transmissions from sensors or input devices and is secured by 128-bit symmetric encryption keys. Zigbee was standardized in 2003 and revised in 2006, and its name is inspired by the waggle dance of honey bees.",

Born in Rostov-on-Don, he graduated from Rostov State University in 1948 and proposed solutions to Hilbert's fifth problem. In 1956, he began working with computers and became the Director of the Computational Center of the Academy of Science of Ukraine in Kyiv. Glushkov established the Institute of Cybernetics of the National Academy of Science of Ukraine in 1962 and made significant contributions to the theory of automata. He was awarded the Lenin Prize in 1964 and published nearly 800 printed works. One of his major goals was the creation of the National Automated System for Computation and Information Processing (OGAS), an ambitious project ahead of its time that received opposition and ended official interest in the early 1970s. Glushkov also founded Chairs of Theoretical Cybernetics and Methods of Optimal Control at the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology and Kyiv State University. The Institute of Cybernetics of the National Academy of Science of Ukraine is named after him.",

It aimed to create a distributed decision support system for managing the national economy. The project included an economic simulator, custom software for monitoring factory performance, an operations room, and a national network of telex machines connected to a mainframe computer.\n\nBased on the viable system model theory, Cybersyn utilized innovative technology for its time. It featured a network of telex machines in state-run enterprises to transmit and receive information with the government. This information was then fed into statistical modeling software ('Cyberstride') to monitor production indicators in \"almost\" real-time and provide alerts in abnormal situations. Additionally, economic simulation software ('CHECO') allowed the government to forecast the potential outcome of economic decisions.

It aimed to replace the manual system of calculating overpayments to welfare recipients with an automated data-matching system. However, it faced criticism for issuing false or incorrectly calculated debt notices, impacting the physical and mental health of recipients, and concerns over its lawfulness.\n\nThe scheme was investigated by the Commonwealth Ombudsman, faced legal challenges, and a royal commission. In May 2020, the Morrison government announced that it would scrap the scheme and repay 470,000 wrongly-issued debts. The Australian government lost a 2019 lawsuit over the legality of the income averaging process and settled a class-action lawsuit in 2020. Federal Court Justice Bernard Murphy ruled against the Government in June 2021, approving a A$1.8 billion settlement.\n\nIn the 2022 Australian federal election, the Australian Labor Party (ALP) leader Anthony Albanese pledged to hold a royal commission into the Robodebt scheme if his party was elected. After winning the election, the Albanese government officially commenced the Royal Commission into the Robodebt Scheme in August 2022. The commission's report in July 2023 referred several individuals to law enforcement agencies for prosecution and specifically criticised former Prime Minister Scott Morrison for misleading Cabinet and failing in his ministerial duties.\n\nIn October 2022, the Albanese government forg",

Practical proposals include implementing a universal basic income and reducing the length of the working day and week. As automation increases and the cost of maintaining an automated workforce decreases, it has been suggested that post-work societies would also be ones of post-scarcity.",

        "content": "Technological unemployment is the loss of jobs caused by technological change, such as automation and the introduction of labor-saving machines. Throughout history, humans have seen their roles minimized by technological advancements, from artisan weavers to retail cashiers. The debate about the long-term impact of technological unemployment has been ongoing, with optimists arguing that innovation will not have a lasting negative impact on jobs, while pessimists believe that new technologies can lead to a decline in total employment. This issue has been discussed since at least Aristotle's time, but it gained prominence during the Industrial Revolution in the 18th century and has resurfaced in recent years due to advances in automation and artificial intelligence. Some studies and experts suggest that up to 47% of U.S. jobs are at risk of automation, but others argue that technological innovation also creates new industries and jobs. The debate over the impact of technology on employment is ongoing and has been a concern throughout history.",

It is independent of application-protocols and can be used by most Industrial Ethernet protocols in the IEC 61784 suite. HSR nodes have two ports and act as a bridge, allowing them to be arranged into a ring or meshed structure without the need for dedicated switches. HSR, along with its companion standard Parallel Redundancy Protocol (PRP), is standardized by the IEC 62439-3:2016. Both protocols are suitable for high-availability applications that require quick switchover times. HSR has been adopted for use in electrical substation automation u",

Released by SAE International in November 2011, TTEthernet network devices implement synchronization services, traffic flow control, packet timing policing, and robust internal architecture. They can also support other deterministic traffic classes without interference. TTEthernet is used in aerospace, industrial controls, automotive, and space industry applications, and has been selected by NASA and ESA for communication technology in various projects. European Cooperation for Space Standardization published ECSS-E-ST-50-16C in September 2021, acknowledging the growing use of TTEthernet in the space industry.",

The optimization of plunge cutter section selection and tool path generation is crucial for multi-axis plunge milling. After each plunge, the milling cutter is offset and material surface is removed in the form of lunula. Surface roughness increases with feed rate in plunge milling. Dynamic uncut chip thickness simulation and cutting force coefficient model are used to estimate machine stability. Cutting parameters and machining parameters influence cutting force and machine stability. Frequency domain model can be used to estimate machining stability.",

They are powered by electric motors, pneumatics, hydraulics, or cybernetic technologies, and are designed to improve mechanical load tolerance and protect the user's body against overload. The exoskeleton's control system synchronizes with the user's motions, and can reduce energy consumption by up to 60% when carrying heavy loads. Unlike passive exoskeletons, which rely on the user's muscles for movement, powered exoskeletons provide intrinsic actuation and reduce the user's risk of fatigue.",

It is commonly used in high schools, colleges, and universities to provide laboratory simulation of industrial robots. The simulation software allows for verification of the robot's abilities, travel ranges, and collisions, leading to increased reliability and reduced completion time in the planning and development process. It also enables programmers to write robot programs and use sensors such as video cameras to obtain the desired position of the robot's end effector. The simulator includes a teach pendant control panel for commanding the robot to pick up tracked objects and return them to a home location.RoboLogix also provides a platform for teaching, testing, running, and debugging programs written for a five-axis industrial robot in applications such as pick-and-place, palletizing, welding, and painting. The software allows for real-time simulation of industrial robot motion using both geometric and kinematic m",

VGR is transforming production processes, making robots more adaptable and easier to implement while reducing costs and complexity. In industrial manufacturing, the vision system determines the position of products on a recycling conveyor, allowing the robot to pick the selected component. VGR technology is economically advantageous for countries with high manufacturing overheads and skilled labor costs, reducing manual intervention, improving safety, and increasing productivity. The machine vision market, including VGR systems, is expected to grow to $17.72 billion by 2028 due to increasing demand for automation and precision, and the adoption of smart technologies across industries.",

The traditional testing process for automated systems is time-consuming and costly, involving a complex setup of equipment and wiring for simulation testing in the integrator's laboratory. This process is only effective for small, simple systems and does not replicate real-time conditions. As systems grow larger and more complex, traditional testing becomes less reliable and costly. Real-time simulation, like that provided by Automation Master, offers a solution by using PC-based software to mimic the automated system's response to control software in a real-time environment. This approach is more efficient and accurate for testing complex logic sequences and timing relationships between signals.",

It links the PLCs to components in the plant such as sensors, actuators, and electric motors, replacing direct connections via current loops or digital I/O signals. Fieldbuses are time-critical and cost sensitive, and Real-time Ethernet-based fieldbuses have emerged since the new millennium, with potential to replace traditional fieldbuses in the long term.",

It is used for basic and advanced regulatory control in process industries, and has been implemented in powerplants.\n\nThere are two implementations of Foundation Fieldbus to meet different needs: H1 operates at 31.25 kbit/s and is used to connect to field devices and host systems, while HSE operates at 100/1000 Mbit/s and connects input/output subsystems, host systems, linking devices and gateways.\n\nFoundation Fieldbus was developed over many years by the International Society of Automation (ISA), and it coexists alongside other technologies such as Modbus, Profibus, and Industrial Ethernet. The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) standard on field bus, including Foundation Fieldbus, is IEC 61158.\n\nA typical fieldbus segment includes an H1 card, PS (bulk power to fieldbus power supply), FPS (fieldbus power supply and signal conditioner), T terminators, LD (linking device used with HSE networks), and fieldbus devices.\n\nFor an explanation of how Foundation Fieldbus works and its use in continuous process control, the Foundation Fieldbus Primer can be found on the Fieldbus Inc. website.",

It detects failures that may increase tailpipe emissions. OBD systems provide access to the status of vehicle sub-systems, with early versions only illuminating a malfunction indicator light, but modern implementations providing real-time data and standardized diagnostic trouble codes for rapid identification and remedy of malfunctions. OBD has evolved since its introduction in the 1980s.",

It was the first level of factory automation and functioned as a programmable logic controller (PLC) by communicating with a standard DEC PDP-8 minicomputer. The first unit was delivered in June 1969 and used to power a gear grinding machine. The PDP-14 processed Boolean equations using ladder diagrams and had a programmable read-only program (PROM) memory. Programs were developed on a PDP-8 and tested with a direct connection to the PDP-14. Later versions, such as the PDP-14/30 and PDP-14/35, were based on PDP-8 physical packaging technology, with ",

        "content": "A PLC is an industrial computer adapted for manufacturing process control, such as assembly lines, machines, and robotic devices. They range from small devices with tens of I/O to large rack-mounted units with thousands of I/O, often networked to other PLC and SCADA systems. PLCs were developed to replace hard-wired relay logic systems in the automobile industry, with the first PLC invented by Dick Morley in 1968. PLCs are hard real-time systems, producing output results in response to input conditions within a limited time. Control programs are typically stored in battery-backed-up or non-volatile memory.",

The Moog 960 was the most common analog sequencer and could produce short repetitive rhythmic motifs. Artists like Tangerine Dream and Michael Hoenig manipulated the sequencer switches in real time during performances to avoid repeated sequences. Synchronizing two sequencers allowed for polyrhythmic phasing patterns. Additional modules like the Moog 962 expanded the sequencing capabilities. Klaus Schulze, Vangelis, and Jean-Michel Jarre used the sequencer's voltage output to transpose sequences. The ARP 2500 was equipped with the 1050 Mix-Sequencer module, allowing for unique sound source sequencing. While digital devices have partly replaced analog sequencers, there is still a continued interest in modular analog synthesists who appreciate the real-time control offered by analog sequencers.",

It can imitate drum kits or produce unique synthesized tones, and often has pre-programmed beats for different genres. The ability to program custom rhythms and beats is a feature of modern drum machines. While typically distinct from electronic drums, some drum machines allow live performance of drum sounds. They have a wide range of capabilities, from playing short beat patterns to recording complex song arrangements. Drum machines have had a significant impact on popular music, influencing the development of dance, electronic, hip hop, techno, and house music. In recent years, software emulations have become more popular than physical drum machines.",

Research in this area serves three important purposes:\n\n1. Cognitive neuroscience: Scientists are studying artificial brains to better understand how the human brain functions, in hopes of developing treatments for diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.\n\n2. Philosophy of artificial intelligence: Researchers use artificial brains as a thought experiment to demonstrate the possibility of creating a machine with all the capabilities of a human being, in response to arguments against artificial intelligence.\n\n3. Artificial general intelligence: This objective, also referred to as strong AI, aims to create machines that exhibit behavior comparable to that of animals with complex central nervous systems, particularly humans. Proponents, such as Ray Kurzweil, believe that whole brain emulation using conventional computing machines could be achieved by 2025.\n\nOverall, research in artificial brains and brain emulation aims to advance our understanding of the",

Early work on bin picking used Photometric Stereo to recover shapes and determine object orientation. Amazon held a competition called the \"Amazon Picking Challenge\" from 2015 to 2017, challenging entrants to build robots that could pick and stow items on shelves. The challenge was discontinued after the 2017 competition. Bin picking is distinct from \"each picking\" and the bin packing problem.",

Different from snake-arm or hyper-redundant manipulators, continuum robots are actuatable structures with constitutive material forming curves with continuous tangent vectors. Inspired by biological trunks, snakes, and tentacles, continuum robots have been commercialized and find applications in various fields such as medicine and undersea exploration.",

Similar to human children, learning in robots is expected to be cumulative, increasingly complex, and influenced by self-exploration and social interaction. Researchers draw from theories in fields such as psychology, neuroscience, biology, and linguistics to develop and implement models in robots, allowing for experimentation and comparison with reality. DevRob is distinct from evolutionary robotics, which focuses on the evolution of robot populations, and is also related to work in robotics and artificial life.",

Starting with a random population of robot designs, the algorithm discards the worst performing ones and replaces them with mutated or combined designs, continuing until a time limit or performance target is achieved.\n\nThese methods are useful for creating machines for complex environments where human intuition is limited, such as in nanoscale or space. Additionally, simulated robots can serve as scientific tools for g",

This discipline involves designing and building nanorobots ranging in size from 0.1 to 10 micrometers, consisting of nanoscale or molecular components. Nanomachines are still in the research and development phase, but some primitive molecular machines and nanomotors have been tested. Potential applications include nanomedicine for identifying and destroying cancer cells, detecting toxic chemicals in the environment, and precise manipulation of nanoscale objects. The definition of nanorobots can also include large apparatus such as atomic force microscopes when configured to perform nanomanipulation.",

        "content": "Neuromorphic computing is inspired by the human brain and involves using physical artificial neurons to perform computations. This approach encompasses various hardware implementations, such as oxide-based memristors and spintronic memories, as well as software-based systems using neural network models. Training these systems can be achieved using Python-based frameworks or biological learning rules. Neuromorphic engineering aims to understand and apply the principles of biological nervous systems to design artificial neural systems for applications such as vision, head-eye systems, auditory processors, and autonomous robots. This interdisciplinary field draws inspiration from biology, physics, mathematics, computer science, and electronic engineering. Carver Mead proposed one of the first applications for neuromorphic engineering in the late 1980s.",

Neurorobotics is based on the concept that the brain is embodied and the body is embedded in the environment, requiring neurorobots to function in the real world. In addition to brain-inspired algorithms, neurorobotics may also involve the design of brain-controlled robo",

        "content": "Pipeline video inspection is used for visually inspecting the interiors of pipelines, plumbing systems, and storm drains, commonly by plumbers to assess small diameter sewer lines and household connection drain pipes. Older small diameter sewer lines are typically made of cast iron or vitrified clay pipe segments, which can be vulnerable to tree roots penetrating the joins. Modern video equipment allows for non-destructive testing of the pipe's interior. Without regular inspection, waste buildup in public sewers can lead to system failures and catastrophic events, so municipalities often conduct pipeline video inspections as a precautionary measure. This helps prevent issues such as pipe bursts and raw sewage flooding onto city streets.",

This is typically done using 3D printing or additive layer manufacturing technology. These methods first became available in the mid-1980s and are now used for a wide range of applications, including the production of prototype parts. Online service bureaus have also emerged to facilitate rapid prototyping. The process involves creating a geometric model using a CAD workstation, which is then sliced into layers and scanned into lines to generate the necessary motion control trajectories for the manufacturing mechanism. This technology has also raised issues regarding intellectual property rights, as it enables the reproduction of designs from a dataset.",

It includes services for functionality, a service directory for discovery and publishing, and service clients for user access. RaaS facilitates SOAP and RESTful communications and supports hardware and standards. It can be considered a unit of the Internet of Things (IoT), Internet of Intelligent Things (IoIT), Cyber-physical system (CPS), and Autonomous decentralized system (ADS).\n\nRaaS also refers to a financial model for purchasing and using physical industrial or service robots. In a RaaS purchase contract, the buyer pays for the use of the physical device through a subscription-based contract. The original manufacturer continues to own the robot and is responsible for updating, maintaining, and providing remote service. RaaS allows buyers to purchase equipment through operating expense budgets rather than capital expenditure. The original manufacturer may also swap out the physical robot with another machine and provide remote service via the Web. RaaS is named after the software as a service (SaaS) business model.",

Unlike traditional automation tools, RPA systems observe and replicate user tasks within a software's graphical interface, making it easier to automate tasks in products without APIs. RPA tools are similar to GUI testing tools but can handle data between multiple applications, such as extracting data from an email and inputting it into a bookkeeping system.",

They are 3D relatives of superellipses and can resemble cubes, octahedra, cylinders, and more. Popular in computer graphics, they are also used in computer vision, robotics, and physical simulation. Some authors include both superellipsoids and supertoroids in the definition of superquadrics. In computer vision, superquadrics and superellipsoids are often used interchangeably, with superellipsoids being the most representative shape. Geometrical properties and recovery methods from range images and point clouds are covered in computer vision literature.",

It can be applied to a sequence of lexical tokens or characters, or a syntax tree. Character macros are used in software applications to simplify common command sequences, while token and tree macros are used in some programming languages for code reuse and language extension. Macros make computing instructions available as a single program statement, reducing tediousness and errors in programming. They can have positional or keyword parameters and have been used to create entire programs or program suites based on variables",

        "content": "A feed forward, or feedforward, is a control system element that transfers a controlling signal from an external source to a load elsewhere in the environment. In control engineering, it uses sensors to detect disturbances and applies additional input to minimize their effects, requiring a mathematical model of the system. Unlike feedback systems, feed-forward systems respond to the control signal in a pre-defined way without adjusting based on the system's reaction. The control variable adjustment is not error-based, but relies on knowledge of the process and disturbances. Pure feed-forward control requires a reliable external command or controlling signal and predictable, unchanging load. These systems are also known as 'ballistic' as they do not allow for further adjustments once the control signal has been sent. Feedback mechanisms, on the other hand, adjust the output in response to the encountered load. These systems could be related to",

Various theories have been proposed to make optimal decisions, with Bayesian DM being widely accepted. This theory utilizes joint probabilities to express belief in random, uncertain, or incompletely known quantities, and minimizes expected loss to determine the optimal strategy. Fully probabilistic design (FPD) addresses the drawbacks of Bayesian DM, expressing DM goals through an \"ideal\" probability that assigns values to desired and undesired behaviors. FPD has an axiomatic basis, theoretical consequences, and has been successfully applied to diverse domains.",

        "content": "A refrigerator, commonly referred to as a fridge, is an essential appliance found in both commercial and home settings. It functions by transferring heat from its inside to its external environment, cooling its interior to a temperature below the room temperature. This inhibits bacterial reproduction and slows the rate of food spoilage. The optimal temperature range for perishable food storage is between 3 to 5 °C (37 to 41 °F). Freezers, a specialized type of refrigerator, maintain contents at temperatures below the freezing point of water.\n\nThe beginnings of refrigeration involved ice, but artificial refrigeration began in the mid-1750s and developed in the early 1800s. The first commercial ice-making machine was invented in 1854, and refrigerators for home use were introduced in 1913. The addition of Freon in the 1920s expanded the refrigerator market. Freezer-over-refrigerator style was common until modern, side-by-side refrigerators broke the trend. Most household refrigerators use a vapor compression cycle, with newer models including features like automatic defrosting and water dispensers.\n\nRefrigerators and freezers come in a range of sizes, with some small enough to chill beverages, while larger ones stand as tall as a person. The invention of refrigeration has greatly improved food storage and preservation, allowing for bulk purchases and longer-lasting freshness.",
