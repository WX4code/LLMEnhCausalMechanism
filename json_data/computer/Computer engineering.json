The goal is to develop a model or algorithm for applying system inputs to guide the system to a desired state, while minimizing delay, overshoot, or steady-state error and ensuring control stability. This often aims for optimality.\n\nThis involves using a controller to monitor the controlled process variable (PV) and compare it with the reference or set point (SP), generating a control action to minimize the difference. Control theory also considers controllability and observability. It is used in control system engineering, leading to automation that has changed manufacturing, aircraft, communications, and other industries, and created new fields such as robotics.\n\nControl theory relies on the use of block diagrams and transfer functions to model the relationship between input and output based on system equations. The theoretical basis of control theory dates back to the 19th century, with contributions from James Clerk Maxwell, Edward Routh, Charles Sturm, Adolf Hurwitz, and ",

In engineering applications, the term residual magnetization is preferred. It is important to note that a large residual magnetization is not desirable in transformers, electric motors, and generators as it can lead to unwant",

This can include custom-made hardware, or a combination of hardware and software. Improving computing efficiency can be done by investing in software, hardware, or both, each approach with its own advantages and disadvantages. Software improvements offer greater versatility and ease of updating, but come with overhead for general operations. Hardware improvements offer speed, reduced power consumption, and increased parallelism, but come with higher costs and reduced ability to update designs. In digital computing systems, there is a tradeoff between flexibility and efficiency, with higher levels of the hierarchy providing greater efficiency. Hardware acceleration is advantageous for performance, especially for fixed functions, but can be challenging to integrate into open source projects due to the need for proprietary libraries. With the development of reprogrammable logic devices, hardware acceleration can now be applied to problem domains requiring modification to algorithms and processing control flow.",

It generalizes a conceptual model or algorithm, distilling a design pattern for easy reuse. Layers depend on each other, with abstraction layers often forming a hierarchy. The OSI model has seven layers, each addressing different communication needs. The famous aphorism of David Wheeler suggests that all problems in computer science can be solved by another level of indirection, which is often misquoted with \"abstraction\" substituted for \"indirection.\"",

This is suitable for applications where an approximate result is sufficient, such as search engines or video applications. By allowing a bounded approximation, significant gains in performance and energy can be achieved while still maintaining acceptable accuracy. However, approximation should only be applied to non-critical data, as approximating critical data can lead to serious consequences like program crashes or erroneous output.",

A cache hit occurs when requested data is found in the cache, while a cache miss occurs when it is not. Caches are effective in computing due to the high degree of locality of reference in accessing data. Temporal locality refers to recently requested data, and spatial locality to data stored near already requested data. Caches must be small to be cost-effective but are still effective due to these access",

The central processing unit (CPU) manipulates data by performing computations. Storage hierarchies are used in almost all computers to place fast but expensive options close to the CPU and slower but less expensive options further away. This distinction has been present since the early computer designs, with the Von Neumann architecture further separating the control unit and arithmetic logic unit (ALU) for data flow and operations. Fast technologies are referred to as \"memory\", while slower persistent",

Another popular way is to use a special type of computer bus between all the nodes as a \"shared bus\" (a.k.a. system bus). Directory-based coherence uses a special directory to serve instead of the shared bus in the bus-based coherence protocols. Both of these designs use the corresponding medium (i.e. directory or bus) as a tool to facilitate the communication between different nodes, and to guarantee that the coherence protocol is working properly along all the communicating nodes. In directory based cache coherence, this is done by using this directory to keep track of the status of all cache blocks, the status of each block includes in which cache coherence \"state\" that block is, and which nodes are sharing that block at that time, which can be used to eliminate the need to broadcast all the signals to all nodes, and only send it to the nodes that are interested in this single block.\n\nAdvantages of directory-based cache coherence protocol include scalability: bus based systems cannot handle growing workloads efficiently due to the limitation caused by the shared bus that all nodes use simultaneously, whereas directory-based systems have no such bottleneck, making them more scalable. However, bus-based systems are simpler an",

This window typically consists of instructions in a re-order buffer (ROB), allowing for execution when operands are ready. New instructions can only enter the window when others leave, and all execution within the window is speculative until committed. The size of the window is finite, and it operates in a restricted dataflow order, not necessarily in program order. This concept is distinct from pipelining, as instructions in an in-order pipeline cannot execute out of order. Out-of-order processors are usually built around pipelines, but not all pipeline stages are considered part of the instruction window.",

        "content": "Memory dependence prediction is a technique used by high-performance out-of-order execution microprocessors to predict true dependencies between memory access operations. By using this predictor, the processor can speculatively execute certain loads and stores out of order while preventing others from doing so, which helps to avoid memory dependence violations and reduces the number of pipeline flushes required for recovery. In addition to scheduling loads and stores, memory dependence prediction has other applications such as speculative memory cloaking and speculative memory bypassing. Different predictors have been proposed to optimize memory dependence speculation, including selective memory dependence prediction, exact memory dependence prediction, synonym predictor, store sets predictor, and store barrier predictor. These predictors aim to minimize the delay of loads and stores, improve performance, and streamline communication of values through memory. Overall, memory dependence prediction is an important optimization in out-of-order execution microprocessors that helps to improve performance and reduce memory dependence violations.",

        "term": "Multi-core processor",
        "content": "A multi-core processor is a single integrated circuit with two or more separate processing units called cores. These cores can read and execute program instructions simultaneously, increasing overall speed for programs that support multithreading or parallel computing. The cores may be tightly or loosely coupled, and they may or may not share caches. They can implement different inter-core communication methods and network topologies. Multi-core processors are widely used in various application domains, including general-purpose, embedded, network, digital signal processing, and graphics. The performance improvement gained from multi-core processors depends on the software algorithms used and their implementation. The parallelization of software is a significant ongoing topic of research. In the consumer market, dual-core processors became commonplace in the late 2000s, followed by quad-core processors in higher-end systems before becoming standard. Hexa-core processors have entered the mainstream since the late 2010s and have overtaken quad-core processors in many spaces since the early 2020s.",

In contrast, closed architectures have one or two \"expansion ports\" using a proprietary connector design that may require a license fee from the manufacturer, or enhancements may only be installable by technicians with specialized tools or training.\n\nComputer platforms may include both open and closed architectures. The Mac mini and Compact Macintosh are closed, while the Macintosh II and Power Mac G5 are open.

Registers may have specific hardware functions, and are used for arithmetic and bitwise operations. They are manipulated or tested by machine instructions and can be stored back to main memory. Modern processors use static or dynamic RAM as main memory, accessed via cache.\n\nProcessor registers are at the top of the memory hierarchy, providing the fastest access to data. Modern high-performance CPUs have duplicates of these registers to improve performance, allowing parallel and speculative execution. Locality of reference, when a program accesses the same data repeatedly, is important for performance, and holding frequently used values in registers can be critical. Register allocation is performed by a compiler or manually by an assembly language programmer.",

It is typically in the form of integrated circuit chips with MOS memory cells and is associated with volatile types of memory, meaning that stored information is lost when power is removed. There are two main types: static RAM (SRAM) and dynamic RAM (DRAM).\n\nThe use of semiconductor RAM dates back to 1965 when IBM and Toshiba introduced their respective SRAM and DRAM chips. MOS memory, based on MOS transistors, was developed in the late 1960s and was the basis for all early commercial semiconductor memory. The first commercial DRAM IC chip, the 1K Intel 1103, was introduced in October 1970, and synchronous dynamic random-access memory (SDRAM) later debuted in 1992. Non-volatile RAM and other types of non-volatile memories exist as well, but they may have limitations on write operations or other types of access.",

If the architecture supports both memory and register operands, it is called a \"register plus memory\" architecture. In this approach, one operand may be in memory and the other in a register, as seen in Intel x86. Examples of this architecture include IBM System/360 and its successors, PDP-11, VAX, and the Motorola 68000 series. These systems support various combinations of memory and register operands for arithmetic operations.",

Processors execute more tasks than the number of cores by using multiple \"threads\" that execute in lock-step. Each core has its own register file, ALUs, and data cache, but instructions are synchronously broadcast to all SIMT cores from a single unit.

This allows for higher throughput and performance at a given clock rate. The execution units within a superscalar CPU are not separate processors but resources within a single CPU, such as an arithmetic logic unit. While superscalar CPUs are typically pipelined, these are considered different performance enhancement techniques. Superscalar execution uses multiple execution units to execute instructions in parallel, while pipelining divides the execution unit into different phases to execute multiple instructions in parallel. The superscalar technique is associated with characteristics such as issuing instructions from a sequential stream, dynamically checking for",

This modular design is ideal for application-specific processors (ASIP), offering customization without the inflexibility and cost of fixed function hardware accelerators.\n\nTTA processors have multiple transport buses and functional units, allowing for instruction level parallelism that is statically defined by the programmer. The architecture resembles very long instruction word (VLIW) architecture, with instructions composed of multiple slots, each determining the data transport on a corresponding bus.\n\nWhile TTA simplifies the control logic and allows for optimizations not possible in conventional processors, it also exposes microarchitectural details, leading to binary incompatibility and complexity in implementing a full context switch. As a result, TTAs are more suitable for embedded systems than general purpose computing.\n\nTTA is one of the few one-instruction set computer architectures that have had pro",

DragonFly BSD has utilized vkernel since version 1.7, released in 2007, with the goal of easing kernel development and supporting internet-connected computer clusters without compromising local security. Similar concepts exist in other operating systems, such as user-mode Linux in Linux and the rump kernel in NetBSD.\n\nThe vkernel concept allows kernel components to run in user space, in contrast to the unikernel concept, where user space components run directly in kernel space for performance, supported by bare metal hardware or a hardware virtualization stack. Both vkernels and unikernels can be used for similar tasks, such as self-containing software in a virtualized environment with low overhead. The vkernel concept also differs from a FreeBSD jail, which only provides resource isolation and cannot be used for developing and testing new kernel functionality in userland. In DragonFly BSD, the vkernel is supported by the host kernel through new system calls and extensions to existing system calls, allowing it to be used as a starting point for porting the o",

It includes a processing unit with an arithmetic logic unit and processor registers, a control unit with an instruction register and program counter, memory for storing data and instructions, external mass storage, and input and output mechanisms. The term \"von Neumann architecture\" refers to any stored-program computer where an instruction fetch and data operation cannot occur simultaneously, known as the von Neumann bottleneck. This architecture is simpler than the Harvard architecture, which has separate address and data buses for memory and instruction fetches. Stored-program computers use the same mechanism to encode both program instructions and data. Most modern computers use the same hardware mechanism, but with separate caches for instructions and data, allowing for separate buses for instruction and data fetches.",

By handling address calculations separately and in parallel with the rest of the CPU, the AGU reduces the number of CPU cycles required for executing machine instructions, resulting in performance improvements.\n\nCPUs need to calculate memory addresses for operations like fetching data from memory or accessing array elements, which involve integer arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, and bit shifts. An AGU integrated into a CPU design can offload these calculations, allowing them to be executed quickly in a single CPU cycle. Some AGUs also include advanced instructions for operating on multiple operands, while certain CPU architectures have multiple AGUs to execute address-calculation operations simultaneously, maximizing performance.\n\nFor example, Intel's Sandy Bridge and Haswell microarchitectures incorporate multiple ",

This technique is known as \"interleaved\" or \"fine-grained\" temporal multithreading, in contrast to simultaneous multithreading. Each thread has its own program counter and architectural state, allowing each thread to execute one instruction every n cycles. C-slowing is a technique that can automatically convert a single-tasking processor design into a corresponding barrel processor design, resulting in an n-way barrel processor that acts like n ",

Components are designed to minimize heat production, but cooling is still necessary. Heatsinks and airflow help reduce temperature rise and prevent hotspots, while fans exhaust hot air. Liquid cooling is another option. Processors have safeguards to reduce voltage or speed if they get too hot, known as Thermal Throttling or Shutdown. Cooling can also reduce ambient temperature within the computer case or cool specific components like the CPU, GPU, and northbridge.",

Most CPUs have multiple levels of cache (L1, L2, L3, and sometimes L4), which store copies of frequently used data from the main memory. The cache is typically made of static random-access memory (SRAM), and there are also other types of caches, such as the translation lookaside buffer (TLB) which is part of the memory management unit (MMU).",

Instead, data flow determines the sequencing of computation, with \"handshakes\" indicating readiness to receive or offer data. These circuits do not require a clock signal to start computation, as data arrival triggers the start of the next computation. This allows for optimized processing of activities that can take varying amounts of time. However, while these circuits are robust, practical circuits are not possible due to the lack of expressible conditionals, making the Quasi-Delay-Insensitive model the smallest compromise model capable of generating useful computing circuits.",

This can happen when an interrupt is triggered but the segment in which the interrupt handler resides is invalid. If there is a problem when calling the double fault handler, a triple fault is generated and the processor shuts down.\n\nDouble faults are rarely caused by user space programs in modern protected mode operating systems, as they are usually due to kernel bugs.

Flags are often found as part of a defined data structure, where the meaning of the value contained in a flag is defined in relation to the data structure it is part of. These binary values may represent different states or attributes, such as abilities or permissions. Flags are commonly used to mark data structures for future processing. Within microprocessors and logic devices, flags are used to control or indicate the state or outcome of operations, such as indicating an arithmetic overflow. Command line switches are also referred to as flags, and they are translated into flags by an option parser in command line programs.",

It may also handle tasks like address resolution and pre-fetching. In the simplest computer architecture, the instruction cycle follows a rigid pattern. In the instruction fetch phase, the value of the instruction pointer (IP) register is used to fetch the next instruction from memory. However, performance enhancing features like instruction pipelining and instruction caching make the process more complex.",

It allows programs to access a theoretical maximum memory of 32 or 64 bits by mapping their addresses into separate areas in physical memory. The MMU also provides virtual memory support, tracking memory use in fixed-size blocks known as pages. If a program refers to a location not in physical memory, the MMU triggers an interrupt to the operating system, which then uses demand paging to load the requested page into memory. Modern MMUs also perform memory protection, manage processor cache, and control access to the memory bus. Earlier MMU designs were more varied, utilizing techniques like paged translation and segmented translation to manage memory.",

It consists of hardware-level instructions that implement machine code instructions or control internal finite-state machine sequencing in digital processing components. Microcode is utilized in general-purpose CPUs and functions as a fallback path for scenarios when the faster hardwired control unit is unable to manage. Housed in high-speed memory, it translates machine instructions or other input into sequences of circuit-level operations, enabling greater flexibility in designing and altering instructions. Through microprogramming, smaller scale microarchitectures can emulate more robust architectures, ensuring software compatibility within a processor family. Some hardware vendors use the term microcode interchangeably with firmware.",

Flags in the register can indicate the outcome of arithmetic and bit manipulation operations or other instructions. Conditional instructions use the flags to determine whether certain actions should be taken. Some CPU architectures don't use a dedicated flag register or pass status information implicitly. A status register may also have other fields for specialized flags or interrupt enable bits. During an interrupt, the current status register value can be stored along with other active registers.",

The TLB may reside between the CPU and CPU cache, between CPU cache and main memory, or between different levels of the multi-level cache. It is often implemented as content-addressable memory (CAM), with the virtual address as the search key and the physical address as the result. If the address is present in the TLB, it is a hit and the physical address can be used to access memory. If not, it is a miss and the translation proceeds through a page walk, which is time-consuming. Once the physical address is determined, the mapping is e",

To address this issue, modern designs employ techniques such as CPU caches, instruction pipelines, and branch prediction to minimize or hide wait states, though no single technique is completely effective. Together, these methods can greatly reduce the problem.",

        "content": "The autodyne circuit improved radio signal amplification by using the De Forest Audion vacuum tube amplifier to allow the tube to oscillate at a slightly different frequency from the desired signal, greatly improving sensitivity over other receivers. This circuit was invented by Edwin Howard Armstrong of Columbia University in New York, who inserted a tuned circuit in the output circuit of the Audion vacuum tube amplifier to dramatically increase its gain, reaching self-oscillation. This allowed the demodulation of the latest technology continuous wave (CW) transmissions, producing intelligible output from previously incomprehensible signals. When advanced to self-oscillation, the autodyne oscillator allowed for clearly hearing Morse code dots and dashes as distinct tones instead of thumps, making it capa",

It is commonly used in MOSFET circuits to pull up the operating point of a transistor above the power supply rail. This term is also used for dynamically altering the operating point of an operational amplifier to increase its output voltage swing. In this context, bootstrapping an operational amplifier means using a signal to drive the reference point of the op-amp's power supplies. This technique can also be used to alter the non-linear C/V characteristic ",

        "content": "Circuit extraction, also known as netlist extraction, converts an integrated circuit layout back into the electrical circuit it represents. This extracted circuit is used for simulation, timing analysis, signal integrity, power analysis, and logic to layout comparison. Different functions require different circuit representations, leading to the need for multiple layout extractions. The extraction process can include postprocessing to convert the device-level circuit into a purely digital circuit.\n\nThe specific functionality of an extraction process depends on its system environment. The simplest form of extracted circuit may be in the form of a netlist, which is formatted for a particular simulator or analysis program. More complex extractions involve writing the circuit back into the original database containing the physical layout and logic diagram. This allows for cross-referencing between the circuit, logic, and layout for simulation or analysis.\n\nExtraction distinguishes between designed devices deliberately created by the designer and parasitic devices inherent in the layout. The process consists of designed device extraction, interconnect extraction, and parasitic device ext",

It is not concerned with the physical layout of components or their positions on a circuit diagram, only with the connections between components. Replacing a component with a different type is still considered the same topology, although in some contexts they may be loosely described as different topologies. Electronic network topology is related to mathematical topology and can be viewed as an application of graph theory, particularly for networks containing only two-terminal devices. Graphs can also be used to analyze infinite networks and multi-terminal devices.",

It was established in August 1996 to standardize SPICE models and model interfaces. In May 2013, the Coalition was transferred to the Silicon Integration Initiative (Si2) and renamed the Compact Model Coalition. New models are submitted to the Coalition, where their technical merits are discussed, and potential standard models are voted on. Some of the models supported by the Coalition include BSIM3, BSIM4, PSP, BSIMSOI, L-UTSOI, HICUM, MEXTRAM, ASM-HEMT, and MVSG. The Coalition also nominated the OMI Interface as the new EDA vendor independent solution for aging simulations, addressing the increasing need for reliability simulation. This standardization will allow silicon foundries to develop a common set of aging models that work with significant analog simulators.",

Unlike conventional flat panel displays, it reflects ambient light, making it more comfortable to read and providing a wider viewing angle. The contrast ratio is comparable to that of a newspaper, and newly developed displays are even better. An ideal e-paper display can be read in direct sunlight without the image fading.\n\nTechnologies such as Gyricon, electrophoretics, electrowetting, interferometry, and plasmonics are used in e",

It is simple to compute, especially in tree-structured networks, and is reasonably accurate. Even when not completely accurate, it tends to faithfully reduce the true delay, making it useful for optimization.\n\nThere are multiple ways to conceptualize Elmore delay, all mathematically equivalent. For tree-structured networks, one can find the delay through each segment by multiplying the electrical resistance (R) with the downstream electrical capacitance (C) and summing the delays from the root",

        "content": "The Franz–Keldysh effect is a change in optical absorption by a semiconductor when an electric field is applied, named after physicists Walter Franz and Leonid Keldysh. When an electric field is applied, the electron and hole wavefunctions become Airy functions rather than plane waves, with the Airy tails slightly overlapping even if the electron and hole are at slightly different potentials. This results in a shift of the optical absorption edge and some oscillations in the absorption spectrum. The effect occurs in uniform, bulk semiconductors and is used for electro-absorption modulators, although it usually requires hundreds of volts. However, commercially available Franz–Keldysh-effect electro-absorption modulators use a waveguide geometry to guide the optical carrier, overcoming this limitation.",

These ICs are made up of miniaturized electronic components built into a semiconductor substrate using photolithography.\n\nDigital IC design centers on components like microprocessors, FPGAs, and memories, focusing on logical correctness, circuit density, and efficient routing of clock and timing signals. Analog IC design, on the other hand, specializes in power IC and RF IC design, focusing on components such as op-amps, linear regulators, and phase-locked loops. Analog design emphasizes the physics of semiconductor devices, such as gain, power dissipation, and resistance.\n\nModern ICs are incredibly complex, with over 1 billion transistors in an average computer chip. The rules for manufacturing are also complex, with over 500 rules in common IC processes. Designers must also account for the statistical nature of the manufacturing process. As a result, automated design tools are extensively used in the IC design p",

        "content": "Line level is the strength of an analog audio signal used to transmit between components like CD/DVD players, TVs, amplifiers, and mixing consoles. It falls between weaker microphone and instrument signals and stronger signals for headphones and speakers. The strength of these signals depends on output impedance and power capability, not just voltage. Consumer electronic devices often have line in/out connectors, typically unbalanced using stereo RCA jacks or 3.5 mm TRS minijack connector. Professional equipment commonly uses balanced connections on 6.35 mm TRS phone jacks or XLR connectors, but may also use unbalanced connections with 6.35 mm TS ",

Different architectures, including MOS memory and SRAM, have been used throughout computing history. MOS memory, the most common architecture today, uses MOSFETs and capacitors for RAM. SRAM requires low power but is more expensive, while DRAM, based on MOS capacitors, requires periodic refreshing and uses more power. Non-volatile memory is based on floating-gate memory cells, used in technologies such as EPROM, EEPROM, and flash memory.",

        "content": "A printed circuit board (PCB) is a medium used to connect components in a circuit, with conductive and insulating layers that are etched with traces, planes, and features. Components are fixed to conductive pads and interconnected with vias. PCBs are used in nearly all electronic products and are cheaper and faster to mass-produce compared to other wiring methods. They can be single-sided, double-sided, or multi-layered, with multi-layered PCBs allowing for higher component density but making repair and modification more difficult. The world market for bare PCBs exceeded $60.2 billion in 2014 and is estimated to reach $79 billion by 2024.",

Named for British physicists Brian Ridley, Tom Watkins, and Cyril Hilsum, it was first observed by J.B. Gunn in 1962 and explained by Herbert Kroemer in 1964. The RWH mechanism involves the transfer of conduction electrons in a semiconductor from a high mobility valley to lower-mobility, higher-energy satellite valleys. This results in a decrease in current, or negative differential resistance, over a limited range of voltages. Gallium arsenide (GaAs) is the most widely used material for this effect, but it can also be observed in indium phosphide (InP), cadmium telluride (CdTe), zinc selenide (ZnSe), and indium arsenide (InAs) under pressure.",

It works in high-noise and live environments and can precisely locate the position of the fault, accurate to within a few centimeters for specific signals. SSTDR systems can be used on live wires and work by sending spread spectrum signals down a wire and waiting for them to be reflected back. Mathematical algorithms are then applied to the signals to locate the fa",

This allows the circuits to experience large strains without failure. Researchers have developed intrinsically stretchable conductors, such as liquid metals, to address this challenge. Designing the substrate and interconnections to be stretchable, rather than flexible or rigid, is a major challenge in this field. Stretchable electronics aims to mimic the stretchability of human skin and flesh while retaining full functionality. This opens up new opportunities for products, including sensitive electronic skin for robotic devices and in vivo implanta",

        "content": "Test compression is a technique used to reduce the time and cost of testing integrated circuits. Initially, test vectors were created by hand, but as ICs became more complex, Design for testability (DFT) and automatic test pattern generation (ATPG) were developed to improve test coverage. However, as chips grew in complexity, the volume of scan test data caused a significant increase in test time and cost.\n\nTest compression addresses this issue by using a small percentage of scan cells to take specific values and reducing test data and test time. This is achieved by modifying the design to increase the number of internal scan chains, each of shorter length, which are then driven by an on-chip decompressor. Experimental results show that test compression based on this method results in compression ratios of 30 to 500 times for industrial circuits with low fill rates.\n\nWith a large number of test chains, a test response compactor is required to synchronize with the data decompressor and handle unknown (X) states. Diagnostic capabilities are also essential.",

Engineers can control temperature gradients, prevent thermal shock, and maximize thermal system efficiency by manipulating these properties. These principles are applicable in fields such as materials science, mechanical engineering, electronics, and energy management. Understanding these principles is crucial in various scientific, engineering, and everyday applications, from designing efficient temperature control to optimizing electronic device performance. \n\nThermal conductance (C) measures how easily heat can pass through a material or system in watts per kelvin (W/K). It is vital in designing heat exchangers, thermally efficient materials, and engineering systems that require controlled heat movement. \n\nConversely, thermal resistance (R) measures a material or system’s opposition to heat flow in units of kelvins per watt (K/W). It is essential for optimizing building insulation, evaluating electronic device efficiency, and enhancing heat sink performance. \n\nMaterial nature, size, and shape impact conductance and resistance, which are extensive properties. The relationship between thermal conductance and resistance is analogous to that between electrical conductance and resistance in electronics. \n\nThe",

Unlike traditional hardware systems, virtual instrumentation uses software to replace complex and expensive hardware, making it more versatile and cost-effective. The concept of synthetic instruments is a subset of virtual instruments, where purely software-defined instruments perform specific functions on generic hardware. Leveraging commercially available technologies, virtual instrumentation has grown significantly since the late 1970s, with software packages like National Instruments' LabVIEW making it easier for non-programmers to develop systems. Companies have also developed \"HARD VIRTUAL INSTRUMENTATION,\" where the hardware itself executes the software for fast real-time processing.",

        "content": "Metal whiskering is the growth of long, hair-like projections in electrical devices. It was first noticed in equipment using pure tin solder and can also occur with other metals like germanium, zinc, and lead. To address this issue, various techniques have been used, including changes to the heating and cooling process, adding elements like copper and nickel, and using conformal coatings. Lead has traditionally been added to tin-based solders to slow down whisker growth. However, after the ban on lead in consumer electronics in 2006, there has been a renewed focus on the ",

This is often due to the need for repeat surgical procedures after initial implantation. Most pacemakers are dual chambered and have two leads, which can lead to increased complications. Between 1990 and 2002, approximately 2.25 million pacemakers were implanted in the United States, with about 8,834 removed due to device malfunction. Studies have shown that a significant number of pacemaker complications occur within the first 3 months after implantation. Causes of failure include lead related issues, unit malfunction, insertion site problems, exposure to high voltage electricity or microwaves, and other miscellaneous factors. Pacemaker malfunction can be life-threatening, but early detection can allow for continued therap",

        "content": "汇编语言（又称汇编器语言或符号机器代码），通常简称为ASM或asm，是一种低级编程语言，语言中的指令与架构的机器指令之间有非常强的对应关系。汇编语言通常每条语句对应一条机器指令（1：1），同时还支持常量、注释、汇编器指令、符号标签、宏等。汇编语言最早用于表示机器代码指令的例子出现在 Kathleen 和 Andrew Donald Booth 的 1947 年著作《Coding for A.R.C.》中。汇编代码通过汇编器转换为可执行的机器码。不同的计算机架构需要使用特定的汇编语言，有时同一架构会有多个汇编器，有时汇编器专门用于特定的操作系统。大部分汇编语言不提供特定的语法用于操作系统调用。而绝大部分高级编程语言在多种架构间通用，但需要解释或编译。大部分编程现在使用更高级的解释性或编译性语言进行，而不再完全依赖汇编语言。如今，通常在高级语言实现的大型系统中使用少量汇编语言代码，例如为了性能或者直接与硬件交互。例如，Linux 内核版本 4.9 的源代码中，只有不到 2%是用汇编写的，而超过 97% 是用 C 语言写的。Fred Brooks 在《No Silver Bullet》中指出了转向高级语言编程的影响：“对于软件生产力、可靠性和简单性来说，最具影响力的突破无疑是逐渐使用高级语言进行编程。大多数人认为这种发展至少提高了五倍的生产率，并伴随着可靠性、简单性和可理解性的提升。”",

It can be called an automatic teller machine (ATM) in the US, automated banking machine (ABM) in Canada, or cashpoint in British English. Customers can access their accounts to withdraw cash, check balances, transfer funds, and more. ATMs can also be used for foreign currency withdrawals, with the money converted at the financial institution's exchange rate. Authentication is typically done with a plastic card and personal identification number (PIN). As of 2015, there were close to 3.5 million ATMs worldwide, although their use is declining with the rise of cashless payment systems.",

It involves directly controlling GPIOs to transmit and receive signals, meeting timing and protocol requirements. While dedicated hardware satisfies these requirements and provides data buffers, bit banging can be implemented at low cost and is commonly used in embedded systems. It allows devices to implement different protocols with minimal or no hardware changes, ",

It often includes the bank's name, a card number, the cardholder's name, and an expiration date. New cards now have a chip for touch or chip and PIN transactions. Debit cards are similar to credit cards, but the money must be in the cardholder's bank account at the time of purchase and is immediately transferred to the merchant's account. Some carry stored value (prepaid cards), while others relay a message to the cardholder's bank to withdraw funds. In some cases, a payment card number is specifically designated for online use (virtual card).\n\nIn many countries, debit cards have largely replaced checks and cash transactions. The development of debit cards has been country-specific, resulting in incompatible systems worldwide. Initiatives since the mid-2000s have allowed debit cards to be used in other countries and for internet and phone purchases. Debit cards also act as ATM card",

        "content": "A flash emulator is a tool used to temporarily replace flash memory or ROM chips in an embedded device for debugging software. It contains Dual-ported RAM, with one port connected to the target system and the other to a host PC running a debugger. This allows for code changes while running, setting break points, and using advanced debugging techniques. The tool became popular in the 1980s-1990s for systems using discrete ROM or flash chips, but as embedded systems integrated processor and flash on a single chip, external flash emulators became impossible. Replacement techniques with \"flash emulation\" in their names emerged, such as TI's \"Flash Emulation Tool\" and generic in-circuit emulators, despite not involving flash or emulation. Flash emulators can also be used for reverse engineering, such as in reverse engineering the Wii gaming console bootloader.",

These vehicles can adjust fuel injection and spark timing automatically based on the blend detected by a fuel composition sensor. They differ from bi-fuel vehicles, which store two fuels in separate tanks. The most common FFV is the ethanol flexible-fuel vehicle, with about 60 million vehicles worldwide. Flex-fuel vehicles in North America and Europe are optimized to run on E85, while Brazilian flex fuel vehicles can run on any mix of E20-E25 gasoline and up to 100% hydrous ethanol fuel (E100). An improved flex motor generation was launched in 2009, eliminating the need for a secondary gas tank.",

        "content": "A front-end processor (FEP), also known as a communications processor, is a small computer that connects to the host computer and various networks or peripheral devices. It utilizes high-speed parallel interfaces to transfer data with the host computer and slower serial interfaces to communicate with peripherals. The goal is to relieve the host computer of managing peripheral devices and handling message transmission, packet assembly, error detection, and correction. Examples include the IBM 3705 Communications Controller and the Burroughs Data Communications Processor. In asymmetric multi-processor systems, a FEP performs tasks closer to the input source than the main processor, such as telemetry control, data collection, and data analysis. In client/server architecture, the front-end processor manages the interface between the user and the application processes on the server, ensuring that the data is processed and delivered to the application in a compatible format. Overall, FEPs and communications processors optimize the use of the host CPU by offloading processing tasks to other devices or con",

Today, gas flow computing is a subfunction of data acquisition and control programs implemented with PLCs and RTUs, with smart transmitters incorporating these functions. The gas flow computer measures mixed gas stream flow rate, gas temperature, and pressure, typically using differential pressure across an orifice plate. A flow computer algorithm is required to convert the differential pressure reading into a flow rate, considering gas compressibility and the effect of temperature. This allows for the calculation of mass flow based on the specific gravity of the gas and the energy content of each gas component.\n\nThe gas flow computer also requires input parameters such as contract hour, location, and metering device materials. It stores date/time stamped volume records in RAM for up to 35 days and tracks modifications to flow parameters in an \"Audit Trail.\" Methods are implemented to remove liquids from the gas stream before measurement, with newer V-Cone technology being used to more accurately meter gas containing liquids.",

It typically involves temporarily replacing the processor with a more powerful hardware emulator for older systems, or using JTAG-based hardware debuggers for more recent systems. These tools provide access to debugging operations and processor state information, essential for debugging embedded systems that lack traditional user interfaces. The use of standard chips instead of custom bond-out versions has made this technology ubiquitous and low-cost, eliminating most differences between development and runtime environments. As a result, the term \"in-circuit emulator\" is sometimes a misnomer, as emulation is n",

The kit included Lego Elements, a \"Smart Brick\" as the brain, motors, sensors, and programming software. Unlike traditional Lego sets, it didn't have a main model, encouraging users to create and program their own designs. It was popular in schools and robotics competitions, and also had versions for educational use. While targeted at children, many adults were also interested, developing alternative programming languages and operating systems for the smart brick. Originally launched in 1998, the line was discontinued in October 2022, but support will continue for the Scratch-based SPIKE controller.",

It is the only land-based ICBM in the United States and part of the U.S. nuclear triad. The missile, named for colonial minutemen, entered service in 1962 as a deterrence weapon. The Minuteman II and III were developed with upgrades to improve accuracy and survivability in the face of Soviet anti-ballistic missile systems. By the 1970s, 1,000 Minuteman missiles were deployed, but the force has since shrunk to 400 Minuteman III missiles. The Minuteman III will be gradually replaced by the LGM-35 Sentinel ICBM, beginning in 2030.",

Originally, it focused on mechanics, electrical, and electronics, but as technology evolved, it expanded to include more technical areas. The word \"mechatronics\" originated in Japanese-English and was created by Tetsuro Mori of Yaskawa Electric Corporation. Initially trademarked in Japan, the word is now widely used globally and is essential for advanced automated industry. Some people see mechatronics as synonymous with automation, robotics, and electromechanical engineering. According to the French standard NF E 01-010, mechatronics is an approach that aims to integrate mechanics, electronics, control theory, and computer science within product design and manufacturing to improv",

It connects to the switching systems of a mobile phone operator to access the public switched telephone network (PSTN). In addition to telephony, mobile phones support various services such as text messaging, email, Internet access, and multimedia. Feature phones offer basic capabilities while smartphones have advanced computing capabilities.\n\nThe first handheld mobile phone was demonstrated in 1973, and by 2016, worldwide mobile phone subscriptions grew to over seven billion. Smartphone sales represented 78 percent of total mobile phone sales. Mobile phones are considered an important human invention and have become globally ubiquitous, with over 90% of the population in almost half the world's countries owning at least one.",

They use specialized hardware with a base in standardized processor instruction set architecture, such as PowerPC and Power ISA. While they share similar architectures, games are not easily portable or compatible between devices. Only Nintendo has maintained some level of portability. Consoles used bespoke processors primarily developed by or in cooperation with IBM. As of 2019, no PowerPC-based game consoles are in production, with the most recent release, Nintendo's Wii U, discontinued and succeeded by the Nintendo Switch. The PlayStation 3, the last PowerPC-based game console, was discontinued in 2017.",

It provides images of the solar corona at about 1 million degrees and was built upon the heritage of the Extreme ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT). Since its launch in 2009, SWAP's coronal mass ejection (CME) watch program has collected images at an improved cadence, capturing events such as EIT waves, EUV dimming regions, and filament instabilities. Its images of the corona extend beyond 2 solar radii, leading to the discovery of the extended solar corona visible in the extreme-ultraviolet out to at least 3 solar radii from the center of the Sun. SWAP was built at the Liège Space Center and is operated from the PROBA-2 Science Center ",

It is incorporated into new ECUs made by Tier 1 suppliers and is used in other standards like AUTOSAR. ECUs in modern vehicles control functions like fuel injection, engine control, and braking. Diagnostic tools can contact all ECUs with UDS services enabled and utilize the fifth and seventh layers of the OSI model. Modern vehicles have a diagnostic interface for off-board diagnostics, allowing for the connection of a computer or diagnostics tool to the vehicle's communication system. UDS requests can be sent to controllers, enabling fault memory interrogation, firmware updates, low-level hardware interaction, and special functions to diagnose faulty behavior.",

        "content": "A watchdog timer, or WDT, is used to detect and recover from computer malfunctions. It is regularly reset during normal operation to prevent it from timing out. If the computer fails to reset the timer due to a hardware fault or program error, a timeout signal is generated to initiate corrective actions, such as placing the computer in a safe state and rebooting. Microcontrollers often have an integrated watchdog, while in other computers, it may be located on a nearby chip or on an external expansion card in the computer's chassis. Watchdog t",

        "term": "Delay-locked loop",
        "content": "A delay-locked loop (DLL) is an electronic circuit similar to a phase-locked loop (PLL), but without an internal voltage-controlled oscillator. It is used to change the phase of a clock signal and is often used to improve timing characteristics in integrated circuits. The main component of a DLL is a delay chain, and a multiplexer is connected to each stage to produce the negative delay effect. The DLL uses a variable phase block, while a PLL uses a variable frequency block.\n\nIn a DLL, the phase of the last output is compared with the input clock to generate an error signal, which is then integrated and fed back to control all of the delay elements. A PLL compares the phase of its oscillator with the incoming signal to generate an error signal, which is then integrated to create a control signal for the voltage-controlled oscillator.\n\nIn control systems terminology, a DLL is a loop of 1st order and type 1, while a PLL is a loop of 2nd order and type 2. The number of elements in the delay chain must be even to avoid irregular duty cycles in the clock at intermediate nodes of the chain.\n\nA PLL can be obtained from a DLL by dividing the number of stages by two, making one of the stages an inverting one and connecting the input of the chain of stages to its output instead of the reference clock. The resulting chain becomes a ring oscillator with the same phase and frequency lock as the DLL, with an incremented loop order and type. It is important to note that if the integrator is chosen instead of the flat gain, the PLL that can be obtained is unstable. The phase shift in a DLL can be specified either in absolute terms or as a proportion of the clock period.",

However, cost cutting led to the omission of a hardware buffer IC, making the ZX8301 fragile and easily damaged if the monitor plug was inserted or removed while powered up. This issue was resolved when the ZX8301 was used in the ICL One Per Desk, where hardware buffering was implemented, resulting in a much more reliable performance.",

It was patented by Atari, Inc. in 1981 and also used in the 1982 Atari 5200 video game console. ANTIC generates 2D computer graphics for television screens or computer displays, delivering data to the CTIA or GTIA chip for color and sprite overlays. It reads instructions for playfield graphics and graphics modes for each frame, specified in a display list, allowing for fine scrolling, interrupts, and customization. The chip inspired the name of the Atari computer magazine Antic.",

Carbon nanotubes are rolled-up graphite sheets that can be either semiconducting or metallic, and metallic nanotubes have been identified as a potential replacement for copper interconnects due to their ability to carry high currents with minimal heating. Despite limitations in assembling them in large bundles, two proposed approaches to overcome these limitations include making tiny local connections for future advanced chips or creating composite structures compatible with existing microelectronic processes.\n\nHybrid interconnects that utilize both carbon nanotube vias and copper interconnects may offer reliability and thermal-management advantages. In 2016, the European Union funded a project called CONNECT (CarbON Nanotube compositE InterconneCTs) to evaluate the performance and manufacturability of composite interconnects using both carbon nanotubes and copper. This project involves the efforts o",

Multiple chiplets working together may be called a multi-chip module, hybrid IC, 2.5D IC, or advanced package. They may be connected with standards such as UCIe, BoW, AIB, OpenHBI, and OIF XSR. Chiplets not designed by the same company must be interoperable. The term was coined by a UC Berkeley professor as a component of the RAMP Project in 2006. Examples include Intel Meteor Lake, AMD Ryzen, and NVidia H100.",

        "content": "Complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) is a type of MOSFET fabrication process that uses complementary pairs of p-type and n-type MOSFETs for logic functions. It is widely used for constructing integrated circuit (IC) chips, including microprocessors, microcontrollers, memory chips, and other digital logic circuits, as well as for analog circuits such as image sensors and RF circuits. The technology was originally conceived in the 1960s and commercialized by RCA in the late 1960s, eventually becoming the standard fabrication process for MOSFET semiconductor devices in VLSI chips. By 2011, 99% of IC chips were fabricated using CMOS technology.\n\nCMOS devices have high noise immunity and low static power consumption due to one transistor in the MOSFET pair always being off. This allows for a high density of logic functions on a chip and reduces waste heat compared to other types of logic. These characteristics have made CMOS the most widely used technology for VLSI chips.",

        "content": "CMOS amplifiers, or complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor amplifiers, are essential analog circuits used in various systems, including computers, audio systems, smartphones, and biomedical circuits. They rely on MOSFETs (metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistors) for amplification, making them simpler and more cost-effective than traditional BJT amplifiers. In high-performance CMOS amplifier circuits, transistors are used not only to amplify the signal but also as active loads to achieve higher gain and output swing. However, as the feature size of MOSFET transistors has shrunk over the years, analog CMOS amplifiers have not seen the same benefits as digital ICs. Short channel transistors lead to intrinsic gain reduction, impacting overall amplifier performance. This has led to the development of novel techniques to overcome these limitations and achieve higher gain while addressing stability issues for closed-loop applications. The progression of memory circuit design over the years serves as an example of how process advancements have affected the size and performance of ICs.",

Introduced in 1997 by IBM with assistance from Motorola, they allow for narrower dimensions and less energy usage compared to aluminum interconnects. This switch required significant developments in fabrication techniques and the introduction of barrier metal layers to protect the silicon. While superconformal copper electrodeposition methods were known since the late 1960s, their appli",

Early controllers were separate cards with different storage methods and data encoding, such as MFM and RLL. Modern controllers are integrated into the disk drive, with SCSI disks having built-in controllers. They communicate with a host adapter over standardized interfaces like PATA, IDE, Serial ATA, Parallel SCSI, Fibre Channel, or Serial Attached SCSI. Disk controllers can also manage access to non-mechanical flash memory.",

It has evolved from discrete components to a special-purpose integrated circuit or chip. The FDC reads data from the host computer and converts it to the drive's on-disk format using encoding schemes like FM and MFM. Data transfers are controlled by the computer's microprocessor or a dedicated microprocessor. By the 1990s, floppy disks were being replaced by hard drives, and controllers also handled data transfer over standardized connectors. In modern systems, the FDC is typically part of a single super I/O chip with many functions.",

The layout engineer uses computer-aided tools to place components based on performance, size, density, and manufacturability criteria, typically in analog or digital disciplines. The layout must pass physical verification checks, including design rule checking, layout versus schematic, parasitic extraction, antenna rule checking, and electrical rule checking, before being translated into GDSII format and sent to a foundry for mask data generation. In the past, layout was done manually with opaque tapes and films, an evolution from printed circuit board design. Modern IC layout is mostly done automatically with the aid of IC layout editor software, involving \"polygon pushing\" to choose and position shapes.",

These designs consist of the arrangement of semiconductor devices and electronic components on a chip, and are created using photomasks in the production process. Due to their functional nature, these designs cannot be effectively protected under copyright or patent law. To address this, governments have implemented exclusive rights similar to copyright, offering time-limited protection for the reproduction of specific layouts. These rights typically have shorter terms than traditional copyrights.",

        "content": "Interconnects in ICs are crucial for proper function, performance, and reliability. They are classified as local or global depending on the distance they can support signal propagation. The material from which interconnects are made and their width, thickness, and fabrication process are key factors in determining their effectiveness. Local interconnects connect close circuit elements, while global interconnects support longer distances. Various circuits, such as buffers or restorers, can be used to extend the signal propagation distance. Interconnects are formed during the back-end-of-line in IC fabrication and their material must be compatible with the semiconductor substrate and dielectric. Suitability for fabrication is also necessary, as some chemistries and processes may prevent integration into the larger technology for IC fabrication.",

        "term": "Interconnect bottleneck",
        "content": "The interconnect bottleneck, which limits the performance of integrated circuits due to connections between components, was predicted to become a crisis by 2010. This bottleneck is caused by the tighter packing of wires on a microprocessor as the IC minimum feature size is downscaled, resulting in increased signal propagation delay. Utilizing optical interconnects can solve this issue by replacing long metallic interconnects, promising better performance even with larger designs. However, optical interconnects have not been widely used in chip-to-chip or on-chip interconnections due to costlier technology and lack of fully mature technologies. There are still many challenges in integrating optic and electronic technologies, including materials, fabrication, and packaging.",

It spreads connections to a wider pitch or reroutes connections to different connections. They are commonly used in BGA packages, multi-chip modules, and high bandwidth memory. Interposers can be made from substrates such as FR4 for rigid interposers, and polyimide for flexible ones. They are also used in interposer stacks as a cost-effective alternative to 3D ICs. Notable products with interposer technology include the AMD Fiji/Fury GPU and the Xilinx Virtex-7 FPGA. Interposers can also be used as adapters to allow SATA drives to connect to SAS backplanes with redundant ports. This provides path redundancy for SATA drives, which typically only have a single port.",

When integrated into another chip, such as a microprocessor, it's known as an integrated memory controller (IMC). Memory controllers are responsible for reading and writing to DRAM, providing memory refresh, and other functions. They use multiplexer circuits to select the correct memory location and consolidate data, with bus widths ranging from 8-bit to 512-bit. Some memory controllers include error detection and correction hardware, and the memory management unit (MMU) implements virtual addressing in many operating systems.",

They are small in size and can be mass-produced, making them ideal for high-frequency devices like cellular phones. Initially fabricated using gallium arsenide (GaAs), MMICs can now also be made using silicon (Si) technology, which is more cost-effective. Other technologies, such as indium phosphide (InP) and silicon germanium (SiGe), offer superior performance in terms of gain and noise, while gallium nitride (GaN) is also an option for MMICs, particularly for power amplifiers at microwave frequencies due to their ability to operate at higher temperatures and voltages.",

It combines customer orders onto shared wafers to speed production and reduce costs, allowing for efficient prototype development. The service, operated by the University of Southern California's Information Sciences Institute, has delivered over 60,000 integrated circuit designs and was founded in 1981 by Danny Cohen. It is based on the VLSI design methodology of Carver Mead and Lynn Conway, and has played a role in the development of the \"fabless foundry\" industry. MOSIS has also been used by students learning chip design and for early testing of processors such as MIPS and SPARC.",

This low-cost solution was widely adopted by OEMs for motherboard and peripheral device designs. The original 53C90 lacked DMA capability, which was added in the 53C90A and subsequent versions. The 53C90(A) and later 53C94 supported the ANSI X3.l3I-I986 SCSI-1 protocol, implementing eight bit parallel SCSI bus and eight bit host data bus transfers. The 53CF94 and 53CF96 added SCSI-2 ",

Its characteristics can be determined by external components using negative feedback, making it a popular building block in analog circuits. Op amps are widely used in consumer, industrial, and scientific electronics, with some high-performance models costing over $100. They can be used as standalone components or as part of more complex integrated circuits. Op amps are one type of differential amplifier, with other types including fully differential amplifiers, instrumentation amplifiers, isolation amplifiers, and negative-feedback amplifiers.",

        "content": "Passivation in physical chemistry and engineering involves coating a material to make it less prone to corrosion. This is typically done by creating a protective coating on the material's surface, often through a chemical reaction or spontaneous oxidation in the air. Passivation is commonly used in the fabrication of microelectronic devices and is essential for preventing corrosion in metals like aluminium, beryllium, chromium, zinc, titanium, and silicon. In semiconductor device fabrication, surface passivation not only reduces chemical reactivity but also eliminates defects that affect device performance. This is often achieved through high-temperature thermal oxidation. Passivation is crucial for preventing corrosion and improving the performance of various engineering materials.",

It utilizes photons instead of electrons and operates in the visible spectrum or near infrared. Indium phosphide (InP) is the most commonly used material platform for PICs, allowing for the integration of various functions on the same chip. Examples include tunable lasers, modulated lasers, receivers, and transmitters. Silicon has also been shown to generate laser light despite being an indirect bandgap material, using the Raman nonlinearity. These optically driven lasers still require an additional optical pump laser source. Pioneering work in this field was done at Bell Laboratories, with notable academic centers of excellence at the University of California at Santa Barbara, USA, the Eindhoven University of Technology, and the University of Twente in the Netherlands.

Most semiconductor components are susceptible to radiation damage, so radiation-hardened components are designed with variations to reduce this susceptibility. However, the extensive development and testing required for radiation-tolerant designs means that the technology tends to lag behind the latest developments. These products are ty",

It stores data within metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS) memory cells on a silicon integrated circuit memory chip. There are different types, including RAM and non-volatile memory. Semiconductor memory provides random access and faster access times compared to other types of data storage. It is widely used for primary storage in computers. Sales of semiconductor memory chips reached $124 billion annually in 2017, accounting for 30% of the semiconductor industry. Note that shift registers, data buffers, and small digital registers without memory address decoding mechanisms are not considered as memory, although they also store digital data.",

It can perform the functions of an entire system and is commonly used in mobile phones and digital music players. The ICs can be stacked using package on package, placed side by side, or embedded in the substrate. SiPs are similar to systems on a chip (SoCs) but less tightly integrated and not on a single semiconductor die. The technology is used to reduce the size of a system, improve performance, or reduce costs. SiPs evolved from multi chip module (MCM) technology and in",

The rate at which MOS transistor counts have increased generally follows Moore's law, doubling approximately every two years. Transistor count does not necessarily reflect the advancement of manufacturing technology, with transistor density being a better indication. \n\nAs of 2023, the highest transistor count in flash memory is Micron's 2 terabyte 16-die, 232-layer V-NAND flash memory chip, with 5.3 trillion floating-gate MOSFETs. The Wafer Scale Engine 2 by Cerebras has the highest transistor count in a single chip processor as of 2020, with 2.6 trillion MOSFETs. Nvidia's Blackwell-based B100 accelerator has the highest transistor count in a GPU as of 2024, totaling 208 billion MOSFETs. \n\nThe consumer microprocessor with the highest transistor count as of June 2023 is Apple's ARM-based dual-die M2 Ultra SoC, with 134 billion transistors. The supercomputer with the highest transistor count as of 2016 is the Sunway TaihuLight, with about 400 trillion transistors in the processing hardware. Estimates of the total numbers of transistors manufactured are 2.9×1021 up to 2014 and 1.3×1022 up to 2018.",

The concept was introduced in the MIT Radiation Lab Series after WWII and has since become essential for ESD protection development. TLP involves charging a floating cable to a specific voltage and discharging it into a Device-Under-Test (DUT) to emulate an ESD event. Changes in DUT impedance over time are monitored using time-domain reflectometry (TDR). The first commercial TLP system was developed in the 1990s, and other commercial systems have since been developed. A subset of TLP, VF-TLP (Very-Fast Transmission-Line Pulsing), has gained popularity for its improved resolution and bandwidth in analyzing ephemeral ESD events. VF-TLP has become an important tool for analyzing modern high-sp",

It involves creating an architecture for an organization's product platform that is based on commonality and planned variabilities. This allows for the derivation of various product variants from the basic product family, similar to the use of vehicle platforms in the automotive industry. This approach focuses on reusing components and structures to reduce costs and time, and has been shown to lead to higher productivity, quality, and time-to-market, as well as lower labor needs. The benefits of this approach are illustrated in the Nokia case.",
